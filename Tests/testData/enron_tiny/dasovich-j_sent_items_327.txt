I also agree.  Until we see how the direct access suspension implementation
issues are resolved, there is a signficant probability that the utilities
will insist on seeing all documents related to an ESP agreement, and will go
screaming to the commission to turn off your DA service if it appears any
portion of the agreement was executed after Sept. 20.  As indicated in
previous calls, that does not mean an ESP agreement executed prior to Sept
20 cannot be amended as to price and other such terms, but it cannot be
extended or renewed so as to give the customer longer access to direct
access without raising the risk that the CPUC will invalidate the extension
IF it chooses to forbid extensions and renewals after Sept. 20.  At this
time we do not know when or if the CPUC will address these issues, although
as Sue Mara has reported, there will be a Rule 22 meeting in a week which
will likely result in utility filings to get clarification from the
commission on these issues.  Beyond that we have no idea of the procedural
schedule the Commission will follow in addressing these issues.

Bottom line:  The existing commercial deals should not be put at risk by
means of amendments as to term of the agreement which were executed after
Sept. 20.  Follow on extensions or renewals to take effect at the end of the
existing agreements can be signed, but will remain at risk untilthe renewal
or extension issue is addressed by the Commission.  Post Sept. 20 amendments
to the price term of existing agreements are very likely safe so long as the
pre-Sept 20 term and quantity of the contracts are not altered.

Let me know if you have any other questions. 

Mike Day

For what it's worth, I concur with Mike.  Option 3 is the most prudent,
and preferable, path.

Best,
Jeff
