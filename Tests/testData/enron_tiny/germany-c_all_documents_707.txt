Transco filed service agreements with the FERC for MarketLink (Leidy - Zone

are as follows:

Transco says that the remainder of the FERC-approved 700,000 Dthd project 
will be phased in by 11/1/04.
The first phase will start construction in 4/01 and involves looping 30 miles 
of pipe in Pennsylvannia and 30 miles of pipe in New Jersey at a cost of $123 
MM. The second phase will cost $119 MM.  I will let you know the primary 
delivery points of the shipper's capacity when I see the filing.
