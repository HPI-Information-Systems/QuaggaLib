I have attached a list confirmed attendees for this event on Mon 6th
November 
so that you can make your own carpooling arrangements. We will be
e-mailing 
you the address of the venue later this week.

I have also included in the 
list the first 8 people on the waitlist. We are
doing our best to organise 
more VC's and another table so that we can
accomodate you as well. We should 
be able to confirm by Thursday 2nd
November whether or not this will be 
possible.

As you will note from the attachment, we have still not received 
bios from
many of you. The purpose of these bios is not only to help the VC's

familiarise themselves with all of you in advance of the dinner, but to
help 
us place you on tables with VC's in your particular area of interest.
The 
FINAL deadline to receive your bios will be TUESDAY 31st OCTOBER at
7pm. 
Please do try to e-mail me your bio by this time. If your bios are not

received by then, we will have to place you randomly.

Also, many of you have 
sent me your regular resumes instead of the bios
that we asked for. These do 
not serve the purpose of providing the VC's
with personalised and targeted 
information about you and why you are
interested in meeting with them at this 
event. If you have sent me such a
resume, we cannot guarantee that it will be 
presented in the same format to
the VC's.

Following are the VC's who have 
confirmed that they will be attending:

Melissa Daniels, Morgan Stanley 
Venture Partners
Jennifer Gil Roberts, Sevin Rosen Funds
John Oxaal, Sevin

Alexander Gove, Walden VC
Kevin Hartz, iMinds Ventures
