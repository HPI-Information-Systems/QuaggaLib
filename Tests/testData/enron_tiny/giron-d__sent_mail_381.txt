Subject: Physical Deals

Please make sure that all physical deals with a finacial component are marked 
physical in TAGG.  Mostly this applies to annuities associated with physical 
deals and imbedded options.   Not clicking physical is causing problems with 
accounting as well as the credit group.

Thanks
