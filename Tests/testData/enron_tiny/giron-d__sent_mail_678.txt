I totally forgot about the weekly meeting.  Sorry.  Like I said yesterday, 
I'm working on getting new books set up for Chicago.  I just need to 
follow-up with Mary Lynn on Friday before I submit requests.  I'm also 
working on OA issues for July.  I will teach a class on Thursday and next 
Tuesday to settlements about OA (just basics like desk price, customer price, 
and liquidations).  In addition, I need to ask you a few questions about the 
Trunkline deal.  When I meet with Mary Lynn on Friday, I am going to explain 
the deal to her.  That's about it.  Once again, I apologize about missing the 
meeting today.
