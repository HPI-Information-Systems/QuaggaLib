Sending again.  Prentice said that she didn't get it, so just wanted to make 
sure that it wasn't lost in cyberspace somewhere.

Cameron:  Thanks for a dee-licious dinner.  (I did steal a couple pieces of 
duck---curiosity killed the cat---and it was dee-lectible.)  

Couple things:  Very, very nice to go through all that to get reservations at 
La Folie and I of course love the place, but I was thinking that maybe we 
ought to go somewhere that's a tad less expensive.  I'm thinking that Sean 
ain't even a big food person, that he's not working, that Molly to bring down 
a king's ransom in her biz, and Tom and Karen are, after all, vegetarians.  
Anywho,  it's really kind of you guys to want to go there, but I'm just 
throwing out the notion that maybe we should go to another place that's just 
a wee bit less dear.  Maybe that other French place that's just one room that 
we went to out in the Avenues.  Just a thought.  Whatever you guys want to do 
is fine with me.

Also, I'm happy to do a "whole family" thing----well, maybe "happy's to 
strong" (we kid!).  I was actually trying to pull it together last Xmas, but 
found out that my sister and her hubbie only do their big xmas party once a 
year, so had to scratch it.  I ain't necessarily all that keen, though, on 
having all get together--particularly for the first time--with the focus 
being my birthday.  So maybe we can have another event sometime soon where we 
can bring the thundering hoards together at one place----Lord help us.

Finally, what's the plan for your dad?  I just found out that I'm supposed to 
be in Houston for an "all hands" meeting on--you guessed it--March 9th, but 
if there's something planned for that evening, I intend to tell my buddies at 
Enron that I can't make the meeting.  Please let me know so that I can cancel 
Houston in advance.

Finally, and MOST important.  Today is the Man in Black's birthday.  God 
bless the real king, Johnny Cash.

Best,
Jeff
