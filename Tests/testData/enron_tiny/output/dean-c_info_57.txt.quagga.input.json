He carried 17 times for 92 yards  and\na 5.4 yard average in the first half en route to a 31-carry, 131-yard\nperformance for the day.\nThis was a day when the run complemented the pass and the pass complemented\nthe run, and it simply gave the outmanned Cowboys too many problems to solve.\nSimms tried only four passes in the first quarter, completing two of them for\na mere two yards as the Horns concentrated on establishing Benson and the\nground game.\nThe strategy paid off handsomely, with the Cowboys putting seven and eight\ndefenders in the box to slow Benson, and Simms responded by com-pleting 16 of\n28 passes for 233 yards and five TDs in the final three quarters.\nThe 5 TD passes tied a school record set by James Brown against Baylor in\n1994.\nHere, briefly, is how the game went\nFirst Quarter\nTexas won the toss and deferred until the second half. OSU took the ball and\nTexas got the strong 18 mile-an-hour wind. QB Aso Pogi led the Cowboys on a\n12-play, 65-yard touchdown drive after the kickoff. He overcame four\nthird-and-long situations by hitting four straight passes, the final one to\nWR Rashaun Woods for nine yards and the TD for a 7-0 lead with 10:33 left.\nAfter the kickoff, Benson fumbled on the second play and OSU recovered at the\nUT 30. The Pokes tried the UT middle twice, but DT Marcus Tubbs and others\nheld strong, bringing up a third-and-11 at the 31. Now in a tight zone\ndefense, the Horns forced Pogi into an incompletion and Luke Phillips hit a\ncareer-best 48-yard FG for a 10-0 lead with 8:14 left. The Horns went\nbackward on a penalty and a sack after the kickoff, forcing a punt from the\nUT 11. But safety Nathan Vasher intercepted Pogi's long pass at the UT 21,\nand Benson started shredding the Cowboy defense. He ran for 2, 12, 13, 8, 7,\n3 and 10 yards to get the Longhorns to the OSU 25. Ivan Williams relieved him\nbriefly and got 5 and then 4 to bring up a third down at the 16. Benson got\nthe first down on a tough 2-yard run to the 14 as the quarter ended.\nSecond Quarter\nTwo more Benson runs reached the 9, then Simms hit WR Roy Williams just short\nof the goal, then scored on a sneak on the next play. Dusty Mangum's kick cut\nthe deficit to 10-7 with 13:09 left. The Longhorn defense forced another\nturnover when OSU RB Tatum Bell fumbled and UT safety Ahmad Brooks recovered\nat the Cowboys' 15. Benson ran for 10 to the 5, but a penalty and a\nstiffening OSU defense forced Mangum to come in and hit a 23-yard field goal\nfor a 10-10 tie with 9:27 left.LB Everick Rawls sacked Pogi and forced a\nquick punt, and Vasher returned it 15 yards to the Cowboys' 46. Benson got a\nfirst down with a 10-yard run, then Simms hit three straight passes, the\nfinal one for 27 yards and the touchdown to wide open TE Brock Edwards.\nMangum's kick put the Horns ahead to stay, 17-10, with 6:13 left. After OSU\nfailed on a fourth-down gamble at the UT 38, Simms took the Horns on an\n11-play, 64-yard scoring drive. His passes for 21 yards to Kyle Shanahan and\n11 and 12 yards to Sloan Thomas were the big plays. He connected with\nWilliams for the final five yards and a 24-10 lead with just 25 seconds left.\nThe Horns tried a squib kickoff, and recovered it at the OSU 16, with 15\nseconds left. Simms hit Williams down the middle for the touchdown and a\n31-10 lead at the half.\nThird Quarter\nAfter an exchange of punts, Benson and Simms went to work again, running and\npassing UT down to the OSU 27. Then Simms hit  Thomas again for 27 yards and\nthe TD. Mangum's fifth conversion  made it 38-10 with 6:46 left. OSU safety\nChris Massey intercepted a Simms' pass at the UT 21 late in the quarter, but\nTB Richard Schwarz fumbled on the first play and Vasher recovered.\nFourth Quarter\nWith Ivan Williams relieving Benson and ripping off some good runs, the Horns\nscored again early in the quarter on Simms' fifth TD pass, a 23-yarder to\nThomas. Mangum's kick gave Texas a 45-10 lead with 9:02 left. Massey returned\nDavid Pino's kickoff 97 yards for an OSU touchdown to wrap up the scoring at\n45-17 with 8:45 left. With Major Applewhite relieving Simms at QB, the\nLonghorns drove deep into OSU territory on their next possession, but\ndeclined to kick a short field goal on a fourth-and-3 and fell a yard short.\n\n900 Number Updated Daily\n\nI update my 900 number every day with football and football recruiting news.\nThe number is 1-900-288-8839.

It was important to get back on track and it was\nimportant to have good balance.\"\nThe Longhorns are 28-0 under Brown when they outrush their opponents and 4-12\nwhen they get outrushed, so it doesn't take a degree in rocket scientistry to\nfigure out why he wants to keep running the ball well.\nBrown also said Benson \"did really well\" in his first start. \"He was pretty\nmuch mistake free and he got better as the game progressed.\"\n\"We expect him to be much better this week. He will understand that Colorado\nis much tougher on defense (than Oklahoma State), so it will be a much\ntougher test.\"\nBrown said Benson, who broke all the Class 5A rushing and scoring records in\nleading Midland Lee to three straight state titless, \"has come a long way on\nblocking because he wasn't asked to block much in high school. Stepping up\nand taking on a hard-charging linebacker is a hard thing to do.\"\nBrown also has stressed that he wants his backs to make yardage after being\nhit and he said Benson did a very good job of that, getting 70 of his 131 net\nrushing yards after contact.\nHe said Benson and the offensive line will have to do a really good job this\nweek to give QB Chris Simms and his receivers a chance to succeed.\n\"We've got to stay balanced on offense,\" he said. \"Colorado has won five\ngames in a row and I watched them in their opener (a 24-22 loss to still\nunbeaten Fresno State) and I thought Colorado outplayed them and had some\nawful things happen to them.\"\nHe said Colorado's offensive line \"probably will be better than anyone else\nwe play.\"\n\"I know Gary's (Colorado coach Gary Barnett) teams are going to line up and\nbe really physical. I think they are back to running the football and being\nvery physical and very sound.\"\nINJURY REPORT: There were no new injuries in the OSU game and DE Kalen\nThornton (knee) and RB Victor Ike (bruised ribs), who missed that game,\nremain questionable for Colorado.\n\n\n\nFirst Issue of 12th Year\n\nLast week's issue concluded my 11th year of publishing True Orange and this\nis the first issue of my 12th year.\nI want to thank all of you for helping make this  a successful undertaking\nthrough all those years, and I'm excited about the future because the\nLonghorn football team is on the right track again.\n\nTrue Orange Speaking Note\n\nMany of you have been asking me why I no longer speak at your Longhorn Club\nmeetings.\nThe answer is very simple. Somebody in the UT Athletics Department has\nblackballed me.\nIn years past, many of the Longhorn Clubs, and particularly the ones in\nHouston and San Antonio, invited me to speak to their members fairly\nfrequently. I always enjoyed doing it, and I hope you enjoyed having me.\nIf enough of you feel strongly enough about it, you can reverse that decision\nto blackball me. If you don't, that's okay, too, because the main purpose of\nthis note is to let all of you know that I was not the one who made the\ndecision to stop speaking at Longhorn Club meetings.\n\nRecruiting Roundup\n\nThe Longhorns haven't added any new recruits since my last newsletter.

That's a 13.4 average per carry, by the way.\nHe is a quarterback who could run Rice's option or Texas' passing attack. If\nyou could build the perfect QB, put another 25 pounds on his 6-5, 200-pound\nframe without hurting his sub-4.5 speed and you would have a perfect 10.
