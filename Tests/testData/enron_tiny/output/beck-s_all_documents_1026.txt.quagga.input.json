These change=\ns=20\nare intended to accomplish four key objectives:\n\nFirst, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=\nl=20\nbusiness model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =\n=20\nThis model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20\naround a relatively small strategic asset position.\n\nSecond, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20\nrelationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=\n=20\ndirectly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=\n=20\nhas become increasingly difficult.\n\nThird, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=\ng=20\nthe ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20\nhindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=\ng=20\nasset positions.\n\nAnd fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=\n=20\nredeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.\n\nENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES\n\nToday, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=\n=20\nour global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20\nbusinesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20\ncoordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=\n=20\nhigher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20\nopportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=\nf=20\nEnron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=\nd=20\nmarkets.\n\nEnron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=\n=20\n(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20\noperations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=\nnit=20\nas well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=\nrchant=20\nbusinesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=\n=20\nnew structure as described below.\n\nMark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=\ne=20\nthe role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20\ncurrently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=\n=20\nof the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.\n\nProviding further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=\n=20\ninternational business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=\np=20\npositions:\n\nRebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=\n=20\nand CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=\ny=20\nfor managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=\north=20\nAmerica and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=\n=20\nwill be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20\nreport to the EWS Office of the Chairman.\n\nSanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=\nhe=20\nMiddle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=\n=20\nbroadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=\n=20\nwill report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =\nof=20\nthe Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=\n=20\nEnron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=\nness=20\ninto Enron Global Assets in the near future.\n=20\nDiomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=\n=20\nEBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=\nll=20\nfocus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20\nattention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=\n=20\nthe EBS Office of the Chairman.\n\nJim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=\nS=20\nto lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=\nder=20\nto ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20\nfacilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=\n=20\nat least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=\nh=20\nAmerica.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=\n=20\nthe Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20\ntransition, Jim will join EES.\n\nIn addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20\nactivities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=\n=20\nbusinesses and the commercial support functions:\n\nEnron Net Works\nLouise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=\n and=20\nCEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20\n\nEnron Americas\nConcurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=\n=20\noperating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20\nmarketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=\nt=20\ninto a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=\n=20\nfor all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20\nAmerica.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20\nOperating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20\nAmericas.\n\nEnron Europe\nThe Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=\nralia=20\nand Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=\n=20\nSherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.\n\nEnron Global Markets\nEnron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=\n=20\nCEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20\nresponsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.

We are creating no incremental overhead in=\n=20\nthe creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=\n=20\nefficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.\n\nTo this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=\n=20\nEWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=\n=20\nnewly defined roles are as follows:\n\nMid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=\ne=20\nOperations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=\n=20\nwith Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20\nPresident and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=\ned=20\nservices organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20\nwholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=\n=20\nservices.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=\n=20\ncontinue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=\n=20\nfor specific commodities and/or geographic locations.\nLegal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.\nRegulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =\non a=20\nregional basis.
