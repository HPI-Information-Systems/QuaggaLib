Prior to the meeting the California folks \nwere given a list of topic areas and specific questions relating to the \nrespective topics. I have a list of those questions that I will be happy to \nprovide if your interested. Following are some notes regarding the discussion \nthat took place.\n\nThe first topic area was about the projected load/resource balance for this \nsummer in California. The Californian's provided a one page listing of the \nvarious resources and anticipated loads that they expect to exist this \nsummer. They expect Peak Demand + 7% Reserves to be 61,125 MW's. They have \n59,209 in total \"existing resources.\"  They expect to have 3,050 MW off the \nexisting resources off-line for much of the summer. The net short position is \n4,966 MW. \n\nGovernor Davis expects 5,053 MW of new generation. The Oversight Board and \nCEC believe this is probably going to be 2,500 MW at best. Many of the \nnumbers were based on some suspect assumptions, including such things as an \nexpectation that BPA will be in a position to make some exports to Cal this \nsummer. \n\nA second topic area is air quality. Governor Davis has asked all of the local \nAir Quality management Districts to relax emission standards for this summer. \nThe problem is that California has some rules requiring older plants to \ncomply with BACT by 1-1-2002. Many plant owners have ordered the equipment to \ncomply and are anticipating being down to install this. There is no single \ncoordinator with reliable information on these planned outages. \n\nNW Power Planning Council staff told the Californian's that they should \nexpect the NW Hydro system to be 4000 MW below normal through October, beyond \nthat who knows.\n\nIt was interesting to listen to the CEC explain how California has gone from \na system that didn't allow long-term energy contracts to the current effort \nto secure long-term contracts with little capability to manage spot and \nshort-term transactions. \n\nAccording to the Cal guys, the state expects to be severely energy \nconstrained starting in June, even if they manage to have capacity. This is \nlargely a function of gas supply.\n\nAn economist from the Washington State Energy Office said the between 1997 \nand 2004 Washington has seen a 150 % increase in demand for natural gas. He \nsaid Oregon is up 110% in that same time frame. Apparently much of the supply \nto get through this winter is coming from storage which will have to be \nreplenished, creating a conflict with anticipated generation capability this \nsummer. \n\nCalifornia is starting to discuss an industrial curtailment program for this \nsummer. Like so many of California's efforts, there is no coordinated effort \naround this program. \n\nThe CEC said they are bracing for 20-100 hours of blackouts this summer. \nWhile this doesn't sound like a lot, I believe the blackouts  at the end of \nthe year were only about 5-10 hours ( this is a guess on my part based on \nwhat I recall from news reports). \n\nJeff\n\n\n", "clean_body": "thanks.  who's jeff shields?\n\n\n\n\tPaul Kaufman@ECT\n\t03/05/2001 01:29 PM\n\t\t \n\t\t To: Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Susan J \nMara/NA/Enron@ENRON, Harry Kingerski, Jeff Dasovich, Sandra \nMcCubbin/NA/Enron@Enron\n\t\t cc: \n\t\t Subject: California\n\nFYI.\n---------------------- Forwarded by Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT on 03/05/2001 11:35 \nAM ---------------------------\n\n\nJeff Shields\n02/26/2001 09:46 AM\nTo: Christopher F Calger/PDX/ECT@ECT, Laird Dyer/SF/ECT@ECT, Michael \nMcDonald/SF/ECT@ECT, Michael Danielson/SF/ECT@ECT, Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: California\n\nI participated in a meeting on Friday afternoon in which staff of the \nCalifornia Energy Oversight Board and the Cal Energy Commission briefed \nrepresentatives of the Governor's offices in Washington and Oregon on a \nvariety of energy related matter.
