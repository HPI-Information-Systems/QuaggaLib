Until we see how the direct access suspension implementation\nissues are resolved, there is a signficant probability that the utilities\nwill insist on seeing all documents related to an ESP agreement, and will go\nscreaming to the commission to turn off your DA service if it appears any\nportion of the agreement was executed after Sept. 20.  As indicated in\nprevious calls, that does not mean an ESP agreement executed prior to Sept\n20 cannot be amended as to price and other such terms, but it cannot be\nextended or renewed so as to give the customer longer access to direct\naccess without raising the risk that the CPUC will invalidate the extension\nIF it chooses to forbid extensions and renewals after Sept. 20.  At this\ntime we do not know when or if the CPUC will address these issues, although\nas Sue Mara has reported, there will be a Rule 22 meeting in a week which\nwill likely result in utility filings to get clarification from the\ncommission on these issues.  Beyond that we have no idea of the procedural\nschedule the Commission will follow in addressing these issues.\n\nBottom line:  The existing commercial deals should not be put at risk by\nmeans of amendments as to term of the agreement which were executed after\nSept. 20.  Follow on extensions or renewals to take effect at the end of the\nexisting agreements can be signed, but will remain at risk untilthe renewal\nor extension issue is addressed by the Commission.  Post Sept. 20 amendments\nto the price term of existing agreements are very likely safe so long as the\npre-Sept 20 term and quantity of the contracts are not altered.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions. \n\nMike Day\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Dasovich, Jeff [mailto:Jeff.Dasovich@ENRON.com]\nSent: Thursday, September 27, 2001 10:06 AM\nTo: Smith, Mike; Mara, Susan; Steffes, James D.; mday@gmssr.com;\nWilliams, Robert C.\nCc: Sharp, Vicki; Higgason, Kelly; Maynard, Michelle\nSubject: RE: Extensions of CA Deals\n\n\nFor what it's worth, I concur with Mike.
