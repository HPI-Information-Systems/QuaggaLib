This credit was the result of reallocations on Enron \nLouisiana's PVR replacement contract for 9612 and 9701 production months.  \nECT nominated the replacement gas and paid all transport expense associated \nwith this contract.  Scott Neal has agreed to pass this money on to \ncorporate.  The net effect to ECT is $0.00.  Enron Corp is also expecting \n$127,000.00.  This is for a similar adjustment ECT received in 1997 that was \nwritten off on 1998 (see below).  The actual amount for the 1997 adjustment \nis $121,080.16.  \n\nEnron Corp has had a $600,000.00 receivable (from Transcanada) on their books \nsince Enron Louisiana was sold to Transcanada.  Enron Corp and Transcanada \nthought Transco was going to send the credits to Transcanada instead of ECT. \n\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Chris Germany/HOU/ECT on 09/02/99 03:34 \nPM ---------------------------\n   \n\tEnron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.\n\t\n\tFrom:  Vivien Pham                           09/02/99 08:57 AM\n\t\n\nTo: Chris Germany/HOU/ECT@ECT, Melba A Bowen/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Mechelle Stevens/HOU/ECT@ECT, Gary Nelson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vivien \nPham/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Re: Enron Louisiana Mtg. 8/3\n\nChris,\n\nIn order for the I/C imbalance between ECT and ELEC be resolved by August \nmonth-end close,  a wire or check made payable to Co.366 needs to be prepared \nby the end of this week.  \n\nPlease advise me the amount that needs to be made so that I can prepare a \nmanual wire/check this week.
