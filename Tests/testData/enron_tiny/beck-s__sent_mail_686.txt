I have my list at home, but I know that we need Dad's sister Jane and her 
husband, Homer and Karen, Sarah in Austin (whose kids are independently 
dell-wealthy) and I can't remember who else.  I know that there were ten 
invitations needed, including Mom and Dad.  The list below plus those in this 
paragraph total 8 - so we must be missing 2.  

I will try to catch David and have him look at the list that I copied from 
Mom.  

Thanks for these.  I will do invitations this weekend.  Do you have the 
address for Josephine's House?  And do we have a time?  --Sally
