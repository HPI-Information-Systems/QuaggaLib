Ditto:  Caps, stink, but if they must be done in the short term, only do them 
for residential (since of course the damage that wholesale prices will 
inflict will grossly outweigh and alleged benefits). But any caps must be 
accompanied by real, strucutural reforms.  Have a great time.  Please let us 
know how it goes.  (I have a sneaking suspicion they listen to you more than 
you let on.)

Best,
Jeff
