Attached is a Petition to Modify Decision 99-06-058, filed jointly by the
three UDCs.  In the petition the UDCs request that the Commission modify the
provision in the decision which calls for a monthly audit of the PX credit
to pnly require such audit for the months of 2000, and then terminate the
audit requirement.  Attached to the petition are affidavits of the three ESP
members of the  PX Credit Audit Selection Committee (AES New Energy, APS
Energy Services, and Seattle City Light) supporting the petition.

The UDCs have requested responses to the Petition by August 3rd, with a
Commission vote by the end of August.
