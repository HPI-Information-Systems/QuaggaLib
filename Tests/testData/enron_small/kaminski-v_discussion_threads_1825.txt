Paul,

Can you give me more information about  your computer skills?

My group is very hands-on oriented and  computer programming is a critical
skill.


Vince

Dear Vince:

In following up on my voicemail message today, I attach my resume below for
your review and consideration.

It's ironic that you called while I was putting the message together.  I
will keep it short and look forward to speaking to you at your convenience.

Best regards,

Paul
