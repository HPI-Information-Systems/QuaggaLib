Rosemary,
After a discussion with Stacey we have decided to change the coding of the 
wires referred to below.  Please code per the original wires to 24091000, 
Profit Center 12854, Transaction type E09.  

Dana is sending the original wires back to you.

Please call me with any questions.

Thanks,
Tammy

Rosemary,
Dana Davis is sending the original wires back to you to enter into the A/P 
system for the month of January.  The wires have been sent out to Southwest 
Bank of Texas so you will only be entering this information into the A/P 
system but NO WIRES SHOULD BE SENT.

Please code (Debit) these 3 wires to 30016000, Profit Center 12854 (as marked 
on the wire request).  

Should you have any questions or problems, please call me at 853-5961.

Thanks,
Tammy

     Yes, its too late and  AP  Dept. Dec. closing was not open on 1/2 the 
only way to booked for Dec  is to do it yourself by Journal Entry.  Dana has 
the wires it was sent back with her
last week.   If you have any questions please let me know. 

Thanks,
RL

Rosemary,

This needs to be entered in December 2000 in A/P.    Is it too late?  I sent 
the addresses on 1/2 and I heard A/P was still open for December on that 
date.  Yes, it will mess us up if you enter this is January.  What are the 
options?

Rosemary:

Here are the addresses you needed for three wires processed in December that 
you faxed to Dana last week.  These are December payables, so they need to  
be entered for December business.   Let me know if you need any more 
information from me.

Thanks,
Pam
