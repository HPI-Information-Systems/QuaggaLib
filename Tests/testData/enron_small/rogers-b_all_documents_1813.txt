Ben and Jinsung,

We have not had time to pass this information by the traders.  If we resolve 
the issues regarding location, unit contingency, etc., we can get a better 
number from the traders.  For now, these are indicative prices only.  Once we 
understand the deal better, we can talk to the traders and get a firmer 
price.  Also, Jim Fallon has requested that his traders receive a term sheet 
prior to agreeing to a price.

Here is the information you requested, based on the assumptions sent in the 
e-mail below:

Further assumptions:
180 MW
Priced at PJM East hub, no cost is added for any transmission
Must be called in 16 hour blocks
Total start costs: $1200 per start ($300 per turbine)
No escalation in VOM
95% availability

3 year capacity:  $3.80 kw/mo
5 year capacity:  $3.74 kw/mo

Claire:
Here is the information for the Calpine project that we talked about 
yesterday and that Jim Simpson sent you the e-mail about.  

Hypothetical 4 LM 6000 Peaking Project in Eastern PJM
VOM:  $2.23
H.R. 10,5000
Gas Curve: Transco Zone 6
Power Curve: East Hub Curve in PJM
Commercial Operations Date: 6/1/01

We are looking for a 3 and 5 year capacity number ($/kw-mo.) one number for 
each time period.  Please let me know if you need any more information 
regarding the project.  Thanks for your help.
Ben
