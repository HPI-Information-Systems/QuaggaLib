Russell, pls set up credit terms for customer for transactions under the 
physical, which may include pricing amemdments. i.e. the MTM risk may sit 
under the physical agreement.  

At this time, we are not going to pursue the execution of a deemed ISDA and 
any price amendments will be handled physicaly. 

Call if there are any questions.
