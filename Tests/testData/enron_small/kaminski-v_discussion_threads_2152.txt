Good morning everyone:

Vince would like to schedule a follow-up meeting on Wharton as soon as
we can agree on a time.

How does Monday the 18th look for you?  Vince is free from 9:30 AM -
11:30 AM and from 1:00 PM - 4:00 PM.

Please let me know if you are available during any of these times.

Thanks!

Shirley Crenshaw
