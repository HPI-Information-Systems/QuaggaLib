I don't know anyone over there well enough to recommend them, so my interest 
is low. However, I have no objection.

Subject: Porter & Hedges

Are we interested in adding Porter & Hedges to our list of approved 
litigation counsel?  Mark Glatzer of that firm has called me and requested a 
meeting or lunch.  I don't want to encourage him if there's no hope.
