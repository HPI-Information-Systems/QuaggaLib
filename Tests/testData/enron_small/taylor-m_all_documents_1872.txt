We use two firms for U.S. derivatives advice - both in New York and both 
highly recommended:

David Mitchell of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft (212)504-6285
Ken Raisler of Sullivan & Cromwell (212)558-4675

David we use for contract issues - what should our forms look like under 
various conditions, etc. and Ken, who is a former General Counsel of the 
CFTC, we use for policy questions, political (lobbying) and e-commerce issues.

Subject: Recommendation of outside counsel

Hi Mark:

As Portland General Electric Company prepares for its sale to Sierra Pacific
Resources later this year, we are reassessing how we deploy our legal
resources.  To that end, we most likely will be in need of outside counsel to
assist us with ISDA issues.  Is there a firm, or an individual that you could
recommend?
