570011 - Prebon said it's their deal
570023 - broker was changed to Prebon
570801 - I'm waiting until after the calc to change del.point to NP
570473 - waiting for calc to add .005 broker fee
570444 - waiting for calc to add .005 broker fee
569957 - changed in CAPS but not Enpower - waiting for calc

Sorry about all those unfinished ones, but Risk started calcing a while 
before I got your e-mail, and they're still going. I'll let you know when 
these deals have been corrected.

Thanks,
Kate

All deals are fine.



BLOOMBERG


DEAL 570473
bloomberg shows fee of .005

P.S. if this did should be Duke the correct entity should be Duke Power, a 
division.......not Duke Energy Marketing..
