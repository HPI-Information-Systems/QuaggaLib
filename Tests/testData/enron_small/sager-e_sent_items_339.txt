Elizabeth,
Below is the one comment from Pacificorp on the CA that I had marked up.  I am attaching the markup I had sent to Pacificorp.  Prior to sending execution copies I thought you might want to look at it in light of the fact that the contingent call option portion of the proposed transactions would likely be a physical deal with EPMI.  I am taking the next two days off but will be back on Monday.

Glad to help.
Only need one change; I don't have Brent's e-mail address, but  I'll trust Sanjeev to forward this:
 
In Section 2, where it says:
"at the time of disclosure or is thereafter  acquired from a source other than the Disclosing Party that was not known  to"
add a comma between "acquired" and  "from".
