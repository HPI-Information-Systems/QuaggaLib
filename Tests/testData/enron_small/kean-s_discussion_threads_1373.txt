Subject: Office Opening

Tori,
I understand that Rosalee is out of the office. In her absence, I thought you 
should be aware of the following. 

PM Mori has confirmed that he is available to meet with Mr Lay on 1 November. 
However, he has advised that he will be unable to attend the office opening. 
Parliament is in session at the moment and budget debate has been delayed as 
a result of extended debate on the amendment to the electoral rules. The PM 
has advised that he will be in budget deliberations on the 31st.

The PM has proposed that he be represented at the office opening by his #2 - 
Hidenao Nakagawa  -  Minister of State and Chief Cabinet Secretary. Nakagawa, 
as Minister of State, is Japan's official spokesperson and will open the 
office in the name of the PM.

Nakagawa is generally regarded as being responsible for the PM's policy 
direction and plays a vital role in supporting PM Mori's fragile leadership. 
Significantly, Nakagawa is currently responsible for the government's 
Information Technology (IT) policies, the Government's most important 
initiative at present. He is vice-chair of the Government's IT Strategy 
Conference and  formerly held the post of Vice Minister of MITI.

In my view, this is not a bad outcome. In some respects we get the best of 
both worlds. The office is opened in the name of the PM and we have the 
attendance of the man who is likely to be more highly regarded among those 
who will attend the office opening.    

I will send separately to Tori Wells, with a copy to you, the draft meeting 
schedule.

kind regards
