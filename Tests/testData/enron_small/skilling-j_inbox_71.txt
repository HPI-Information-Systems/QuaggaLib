Subject:	RE:  MS150

I am sure that you have forwarded this email to a more senior Michael Brown, however, I would be glad to pledge to Jeff's ride this weekend.  You see, last fall my daughter died of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), she was nine months old and if they find a cure for MS, the cure for SMA will not be far behind as they are similar diseases.

So I would like to pledge $500 towards the ride in honor of my daughter, Hayden.  All I ask is that when the ride gets really hard, to think of her & all the others like her that will benefit from this ride, then pedal a little harder.

You can send someone to pick up my check as I am located @ EB 3108F.

Sincerely,
Michael L. Brown
