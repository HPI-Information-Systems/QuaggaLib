Thanks Rose for update re assignment language.

Kay/Sheila - Is the language below the same language presently in the form=
=20
contract?  If the language is the same, then I gather from Rose that she is=
=20
OK with it but thinks you may not be happy with it.  If instead the languag=
e=20
is different, then we should run the form contract language past Rose for=
=20
comments.  If the latter applies, please send the language to Rose (and cop=
y=20
me) as I am not sure if I have the latest version.

I have attached a copy of the assignment provisions we agreed to with GE fo=
