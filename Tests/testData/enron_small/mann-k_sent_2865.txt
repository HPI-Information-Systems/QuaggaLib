Kay:

My notes indicate that the promissory note structure was used not due to HS=
R
concerns, but rather, in order to avoid issues associated with
disproportionate distributions resulting from the contribution of funds as
capital.  I believe that the use of an LLC as the subject entity eliminated
the HSR issues.  Of course, the higher HSR threshold is also now effective.=

Carloyn,

Is the promissory note structure still necessary, given the increase in the
HSR threshhold?
