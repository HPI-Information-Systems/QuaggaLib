Hey there, 
Have I got a potential job opportunity for you.  My neighbor at work since 
this business plan to me to see if knew anyone who would be interested in 
joining this company and believe it or NOT, I thought of you.  Give me a call 
when you go through this BP.  Keep this confidential.  How did you like those 
pics from Chobs of the girls on the beach.  Have you taken them home yet and 
done unspeakable things to them? See ya!
Thanks
Ben
