************  What will the Bush tax cut mean to your family? ***********

The Heritage Foundation has analyzed the President's tax relief package and
has created a simple mechanism for you to determine quickly how much it
would save you in taxes each year.

Try it out for yourself at: http://www.heritage.org/taxcalculator
This Heritage Tax Calculator will allow you to simulate some key elements
of
President George W. Bush's tax plan and how those tax law changes will
affect you. The Calculator shows the savings to taxpayers of the fully
phased in proposals by President Bush for marginal rates, the dual earner
deduction for married couples, the doubling of the child tax credit to
$1,000, and the deductibility of charitable contributions by taxpayers who
use the standard deduction. By entering in your income and a few other bits
of information, you can quickly get an idea of how much money the
President's tax cut plan will save you.
