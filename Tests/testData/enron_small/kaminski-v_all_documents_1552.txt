Martin,

All other things equal, I would prefer March 2nd as the following Friday is 
the beginning of spring break for HISD.   Can you check with Racicot and 
Fallon?

Hi Stinson,

Eventually, the team here (Giuseppe, Eric, myself) has converged to two
possible dates to propose for a visit:

1) Friday, March 2
2) Friday, March 9

How do these look on your side?

We'll structure the agenda immediately after we fix the date.

I look forward to seeing you again.

Best,
Nick
