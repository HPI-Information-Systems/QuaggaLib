Tana,

This confirms our conversation today regarding Amerada Hess Corporation's
ability to trade on Enron On-line.  As discussed, I will check to see what
specific products we intend to trade with regard to Energy, Physicals,
and/or Derivatives.  I will also check to see whether we intend to trade in
the US, Canada, and/or Europe. I do understand that you cannot give me an
accurate answer as to our ability to trade On-line until I provide this to
you.  Thank you for getting back to me so quickly, I will try to do the
same.

Regards,
