Carl,

Will you please have someone input this information into the pricing model?

Thanks,

Michelle, I just faxes you an executed copy of the CA.

In addition, please find the turbine payment schedule, attached.  We are 
possibly signing a deal for the April 2000 payment ($69MM) tomorrow (so move 
quickly if you want that one!).  Therefore, I would suggest that you mainly 
focus on the payments scheduled after April 2000.  Finally, please keep in 
mind that the last column is for ABB turbines for our Arkansas project (the 
rest are GE).

Please give me a call to discuss.  I should be in the office today until 
around 2:00, and then back on Monday.

Regards,
