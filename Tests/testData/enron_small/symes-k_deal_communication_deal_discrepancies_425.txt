Did you find out anything about this deal?  We really need to get this out of 
the NEW Counterparty status.

Thanks!

This deal was entered as New Counterparty which is fine for a short period of 
time.  However, within a few days someone needs to make sure to change the 
deal to the correct counterparty name.  Can you look into this and let me 
know?

Thanks!
