Hi Theresa,

I just got through redrafting for October to pull in the new storage volumes and prices. It looks like there are three new demand charges. I don't really understand since the last email you sent said you had to reduce the demand charge. If these demand charges are valid then we would need to send out a revised manual invoice. Let me know either way.

Thanks!
