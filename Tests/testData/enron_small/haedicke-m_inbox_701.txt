FERC Enacts Major Constraints=20
on Wholesale Market



By Will McNamara

AEP, Entergy Corp. and Southern Company told by FERC to charge cost-based p=
rices instead of market-based prices for wholesale spot transactions.=20

[News item from Reuters] The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FER=
C) voted 3-1 last week to adopt new rules to measure market power, as a con=
dition for approving mergers and granting utilities the right to trade powe=
r in the wholesale market. FERC commissioners said the new test would impro=
ve a system that allowed a meltdown to take place in the California market =
last winter, when wholesale power prices soared to record highs amid tight =
supplies. FERC commissioners agreed to produce a new market power test base=
d on supply margin assessments, which examines a company's importance in se=
rving peak electricity loads. "If you're big enough to control the market a=
t the time we look at it, you'll have mitigation put on you," said FERC Cha=
irman Pat Wood.=20

Analysis: Many participants in the wholesale sector of the energy industry =
are still reeling from FERC's new ruling, which may have slipped past some =
radar screens considering that it was issued right before the long holiday =
weekend. This is a mammoth ruling on FERC's part, however, and it holds tre=
mendous impact for those companies that increasingly find the lion's share =
of their profits coming from wholesale transactions. In addition, state reg=
ulators have also started gauging the impact of the ruling on retail rates,=
 which some utilities may seek to increase as a way to compensate for shrin=
king profits in their wholesale operations. While FERC has presented this r=
uling as an attempt to circumvent on the national level problems experience=
d in the California market, the new limits on wholesale transactions can al=
so be seen as another example of the "big stick" that the commission is usi=
ng to force utilities into participating in regional transmission organizat=
ions (RTO). Further, the ruling is another striking indication that Chairma=
n Wood is following through with his promise to monitor rampant wholesale m=
arkets while still attempting to support competition. The objective represe=
nts a tall order, and the new ruling from the commission is certain to prom=
pt intense resistance among companies involved in wholesale trading.=20

Put into a nutshell, FERC has ruled that some companies can no longer charg=
e unregulated, market-based rates for spot market wholesale transactions. I=
nstead, companies identified as having market power and that aren't part of=
 an approved RTO must charge cost-based prices for power that isn't committ=
ed in a long-term contract, and publicly disclose those cost-based prices. =
Columbus, Ohio-based American Electric Power (NYSE: AEP), Atlanta-based Sou=
thern Company (NYSE: SO) and New Orleans-based Entergy Corp. (NYSE: ETR) ha=
ve been singled out as case studies on which FERC will be immediately apply=
ing its new standards for wholesale transactions. Note that Mirant Corp., a=
 former subsidiary of Southern Company, has also been identified as having =
to submit information to FERC in order to gauge its level of market power s=
eparate from its former parent. The commission has essentially determined t=
hat these three utilities hold an unacceptable level of market power in the=
 areas in which they operate. Under FERC's new market power "test," a gener=
ator or marketer is viewed as having too much market power if its electrici=
ty is "pivotal" during peak demand, which enables the company to demand a p=
rice above competitive levels. Regional transmission constraints will also =
be considered now as a measurement of a company's market power. This is a d=
ramatic departure from previous standards, by which (under one of FERC's ma=
in criterions) a company that supplied less than 20 percent of the power ne=
eded in a particular region was freed from rate regulation on the federal l=
evel.=20

There are some important exceptions to the ruling. First, FERC has not elim=
inated the utilities' ability to charge market-based rates in areas where t=
he grid and markets are controlled by a FERC-approved RTO. This is signific=
ant, as I will expand upon subsequently, because it indicates that there ar=
e secondary objectives in FERC's new ruling. In addition, the current rulin=
g only impacts short-term sales transactions in which these three utilities=
 are involved. In other words, long-term contracts that the three companies=
 may have previously established or will establish in the future are not im=
pacted by the ruling. However, the three companies named in the ruling will=
 have to post pricing information related to long-term contracts, and FERC =
has retained the possibility that further price mitigation for long-term co=
ntracts may be necessary. Also note that the Western market, which already =
is under a price mitigation policy that FERC imposed in June, was not inclu=
ded in the new ruling.=20

The three utilities named in the ruling now have 15 days to submit proposal=
s to FERC outlining a transition to charging cost-based wholesale rates for=
 all power not currently committed to a buyer. Specifically, the utilities =
will have to post on their open-access same-time information systems (OASIS=
) the incremental cost of producing the uncommitted power during each hour =
in a 24-hour period. Moving forward, the price that the utilities can charg=
e for non-committed power on the spot market will be the difference between=
 their cost of production and the bid of more expensive power in the region=
 that their power displaces. The new cost-based rates must be administered =
by an independent third party.=20

The new pricing standards revert back to an older, cost-based technique kno=
wn as "split the savings." The methodology for this standard can get rather=
 complicated, but essentially under FERC's new ruling the three companies i=
dentified will have to post their cost-based, incremental costs for spot po=
wer into the OASIS system for viewing by potential purchases. Purchasers wh=
o want to make a bid will post their decremental energy bid for not produci=
ng or buying the power on their own. The final price for the transactions w=
ill be the split between the seller's incremental cost and the buyer's decr=
emental bid. For instance, if Southern Company bids its incremental cost at=
 $20/MWh and a purchaser bids its decremental cost at $30/MWh, the transact=
ion price would be $25/MWh. Assuming a midnight-to-midnight trading day, se=
llers would have to submit their incremental bid by noon on the previous da=
y and buyers would submit their decremental bids by 6 p.m. What this potent=
ially creates is an "information advantage" for buyers who have six hours t=
o evaluate and respond to the incremental bids from some sellers. Some of t=
he drawbacks to this system are that it requires both parties to post price=
 information that may not be readily available and it potentially allows th=
e purchaser to game the system by having access to the seller's original in=
cremental bid and competing around the seller's price.=20

Note also that in a separate development FERC simultaneously opened a broad=
 investigation under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act to apply the new =
market-based-sales policy to all U.S. sellers nationwide. What this means i=
s that, although only three utilities are mentioned in this initial order, =
it is expected that FERC will continue to take steps to constrain what it b=
elieves to be erratic wholesale markets. Reportedly, some 30 companies are =
awaiting similar reviews by FERC to determine if the commission believes th=
ey exert market power. The 206 investigation reportedly also requires power=
 providers with market-based sales authority to amend their tariffs within =
60 days to provide FERC with open-ended authority to order refunds if the c=
ommission determines that market manipulation has occurred.=20

I made a previous reference to the "big stick" that FERC is carrying relate=
d to participation in RTOs. Remember that a few months ago, Chairman Wood h=
ad threatened to deny utilities that refused to join an RTO the benefits of=
 charging market-based wholesale rates and swift approvals for merger appli=
cations, advantages that the chairman equated with the "new world" of the d=
eregulated energy market. With this in mind, note that only Southern Compan=
y, Entergy and AEP are included in the present ruling (although it may be s=
ubsequently expanded). Southern Company and Entergy in particular have exhi=
bited some resistance in following FERC's consolidation mandate regarding n=
ational RTOs, so it is probably not a mere coincidence that these three uti=
lities have been singled out. This must be particularly painful for Souther=
n Company, which gains a good part of its profits from wholesale trading an=
d previously expressed plans to double the size of its generation assets ov=
er the next five years.=20

Interestingly, Commissioner Linda Key Breathitt represented the single diss=
enting vote in the ruling. Breathitt's concern was that the ruling had been=
 pulled together too quickly and not enough time had been provided to evalu=
ate the impact on wholesale markets. This issue will undoubtedly be contest=
ed, and to a certain extent the utilities impacted by the ruling appear to =
have been caught off-guard. AEP, Entergy and Southern Company all issued st=
atements to the effect that they were uncertain about the extent to which t=
he ruling would impact them, and that they were reserving the right for pos=
sible litigation.=20

Moreover, to summarize the commission's rulemaking, I think there are a han=
dful of important points that should be considered. First, the ruling illus=
trates the steps that FERC is taking to revoke market-price authority that =
was for the most part unrestricted prior to the time that Pat Wood assumed =
his post as chairman. Second, FERC is implementing cost-based prices on the=
 spot market only, and in only very defined circumstances. However, this co=
uld be an indication that the commission may extend cost-based pricing to o=
ther wholesale transactions, including long-term contracts, at a later time=
. Third, the "split the savings" cost-based formula could become fraught wi=
th its own problems. Its requirements are rather complex and it offers the =
potential to give power purchasers a market advantage on the spot market ov=
er power sellers, which will now be required to post incremental costs in t=
he bidding process. Finally, one of the inherent drivers of FERC's new ruli=
ng is its desire to have large utilities join the RTOs that the commission =
has approved. It is very significant that the new ruling immediately impact=
s AEP, Entergy and Southern Company, utilities that have not only been deem=
ed by the commission to have market power in their regions but which have a=
lso not yet joined an approved RTO. However, even though only three compani=
es are immediately impacted by this ruling, it should not be overlooked tha=
t the ruling holds impact for the market as a whole as other sellers now wi=
ll gain important pricing information about the major suppliers in certain =
areas. Thus, overall this is a very significant ruling and one that could s=
ubstantially change the manner in which transactions in the wholesale power=
 market are conducted.=20
