Susan:  You've just hit the nail on the head!  Remember, for FX trading ENA 
is always the principal, either in Houston, through EEFT as agent (under 
services agreement which I presume covers FX deals) or Enron Japan Corp. 
(under services agreement).  Most problematic are the counterparties since 
they could originate from anywhere in the world.

I have heard that Enron Japan had some GTC's that contained "universal tax 
reps" but I haven't checked it out.  Why don't you give me a call.

Sara,

Which Enron entities would be a party to the transactions?  Also, where would 
the counterparties likely be organized and doing business?

Best regards,
Susan

Subject: EOL tax reps

Susan:

The internal EOL FX products will be opened up to third parties shortly.  I'm 
reviewing the GTC's.  With respect to the tax reps which are incorporated 
into the GTC's, I think we need a "universal" rep since the products could be 
traded by parties residing anywhere in the world.  I believe that the first 
week in March is the target EOL date.  

Can you prepare the tax rep section for the GTC's?  I am not aware of any 
other EOL product having this type of rep but I am not familiar with the 
totality of EOL products.

Please call me if you have any questions.  Thanks.
