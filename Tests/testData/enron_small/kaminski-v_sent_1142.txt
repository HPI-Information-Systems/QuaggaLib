Vince,

Debbie and I are trying to pick a day for an open house invite to a few 
woodlands locals over, so if you would like to drop in please let me know 
what your home phone number is (or cellular) so I can contact you. I'm going 
to invite Beth, Mike Fowler, and Jennifer Richard over too...

When does your wife fly in?, it would be great to see her too!

regards

Steve
