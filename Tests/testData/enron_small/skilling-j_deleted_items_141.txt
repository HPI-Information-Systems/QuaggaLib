SBSC RELEASES 40 PAGE GUIDE TO
U.S. ENERGY POLICY HISTORY & POLICY OPTIONS

Washington, D.C.-The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) has just
issued a 40 page guide to a successful U.S. energy policy.  The new SBSC
report provides a wealth of energy facts; a history of U.S. energy policy; a
sober assessment of global warming and related proposed policies; a look at
what has gone wrong in states like California; and an assessment of the Bush
administration's energy proposals.

 "Our energy crisis today is not about a looming depletion of energy
resources, threatened destruction of the environment, wasteful consumers,
greedy energy companies, or even OPEC.  Instead, we are experiencing a
crisis of misguided government rules, regulations, and taxes that have
endangered consumers, businesses of every size and type, U.S.
competitiveness, and the economy," said SBSC chief economist Raymond J.
Keating, author of the SBSC report entitled "Energy Freedom: Lifting
Government Burdens on U.S. Energy Producers & Consumers."

"Nothing is more crucial to the future of the economy and survival of small
businesses than a successful energy policy," said SBSC president Darrell
McKigney.  "Our goal in this report is to show that providing relief from
regulatory restrictions and red tape, expanding energy exploration and
development, and reducing international trade barriers are the real keys to
successful energy plan."

The complete 40 page "Energy Freedom: Lifting Government Burdens on U.S.
Energy Producers & Consumers" is the latest report in SBSC's "21st Century
Small Business Policy Series," and can be downloaded from the group's
website at www.sbsc.org,  or you can request a printed copy by calling
Priscilla Tacujan at (202) 785-0238.

Author Ray Keating is available for interviews, as is SBSC President Darrell
McKigney.

SBSC is a leading national nonprofit, nonpartisan small business advocacy
group headquartered in Washington, D.C.  For more information, call SBSC at
