Attached are 2 documents describing the reorganization of the west trading =
desk.  I have assigned new books to all of the traders except Phillip. We a=
re currently moving the August physical trades into the new books and plan =
to be finished tomorrow. You will continue to use your existing financial b=
ooks through July 31st.  All August physical deals done during bid week sho=
uld flow into the new physical books and the old financial books.   Your fi=
nancial trades will move on the night of July 1st after we calc.  Starting =
August 1st, you will have your positions in your new financial and physical=
 books.  Russ is working on adding the new books to the West Intramonth Pos=
ition Portfolio in Sitara.  You should be able to see your physical positio=
ns for August in the new books as soon as we get all of the deals moved (to=
morrow evening at the latest).  The positions will be close in the morning,=
 we just need to verify that we have not missed any deals and move all of t=
he intra-desk deals.  Please let me know if you have any questions or conce=
rns.

Thanks=20
