Here is a very rough draft -- an outline, really -- of an answer to Indicated 
Shippers' protest.

Please provide comments as you see fit.  I will probably not have time to 
look at them until later in the afternoon tomorrow, at which time I will also 
do a lot more writing (i.e., making complete sentences, transitions, heading, 
conclusion, etc.).  In other words, of greatest interest to me right now are 
your ideas on the best way to rebut the Shippers' arguments (including 
identifying those that might be safe to ignore). 

Thank you!
