Read it and weep...Just let me know if you want me to bring some sand back 
with me in case you don't make it out there this weekend.  I'm thinking I may 
need to get Julie to hook me up with a job like hers...if it will allow me to 
live like we're evidently going to this weekend.

HI Susan-

I'm so excited for your visit this weekend!  Whenever you get a chance, let
me know your arrival time on Saturday and departure on Monday so I can plan
around them both....

I've been brainstorming some fun things for us to do, and thought we could
spend some time lounging at the beach, shopping at the outlet center near
me, go out for a champagne bunch on Sunday, grill out on the beach, and
possibly go to a polo match or the Del Mar races.  Which of these interests
you?  Are there any tourist sites that you would like to see while in
town?  The zoo, Balboa Park (where all the museums are), or anything
else?  Oh- I've arranged for us to have a massage on Monday- the woman is
coming to my house!  We'll each get a 30 minute massage....I think this
will be great quality, girl time!  I've missed our shopping binges!

Please bring any current pictures of friends and family- I can't wait to
hear how everyone in your life is doing.  Weather has been beautiful as
usual- about 75 degrees and perfect.  In the evenings it gets cool enough
to wear you need a light sweater or jacket, but you can always borrow
something from me, too.

The condo I'm living in now is tiny, but cute.  I've been living there for
a year and am moving out in 2 weeks.  I could have moved out this Labor Day
weekend, but obviously didn't want to be doing that while you were in
town.  So you'll have to excuse a bit of the mess and come back another
time when I move into the cuter place- I love the new place I'm moving
into- it's 2 stories with vaulted ceilings and lots of skylights.

See you soon!
Julie
