Anil,

You are "The Man".  Presentation looks awesome.  I think it hits all of the
key
elements and in an interesting and dynamic fashion.  With the sparkling
personality of Mr Dasovich and the thoroughness of our analysis, we should
be
putting the other groups to shame.  I see our biggest task will be
presenting it
all under 20 minutes.

Unless anyone has any changes, I'll go ahead and forward it to Tasker.  Let
me
know by 2pm so we have time to get it to her.  I'll have it on my laptop as
well
in case she has any problems.
