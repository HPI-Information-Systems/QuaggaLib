Sara,

Please see the attached correspondence between Stephanie Panus of Enron and
myself. I only received the required, original Notary Certificate from
Stephanie this past Friday, although it was first requested back in
December.

Now that I have it, I am expediting the process of obtaining the Apostille
and sending the Agreement off to our Zurich office for signature. We should
have your originals to you by next week sometime.

Please do not hesitate to call me if you have questions about any of this.
My number is 646-836-2011.

Thank you,
Kimberly Dautenhahn
