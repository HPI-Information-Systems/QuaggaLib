Everyone,

A few months ago Enron was contacted by the firm Barnes Mosher Whitehurst 
Lauter & Partners.  Enron was asked to join a new coalition called the 
California Energy Alliance.  The purpose of CEA is to identify opinion 
leaders, union members and registered voters who can be mobilized in support 
of streamlining California's process for building power plants.  

Both Paul and I have had conversations with the partners at BMWL.  Today, I 
left a message for one of the partners that Enron will not be participating 
in the coalition and wished them well in their efforts.  I wanted you all to 
be aware of the telephone call and understand that Enron would not be 
involved in the coalition's efforts.
