 UT Baseball Team in Regional; Football Recruiting Picking Up Steam

 The slumping Longhorn baseball team made the 64-team NCAA Touarnment
 field,=20
 getting a No. 3 seed in a sub-regional at Stanford.
 The Longhorns, 34-24 overall after going 0-2 despite a No. 3 seed in the
 Big=
 =20
 12 Tournament, also got a No. 3 seed in the Palo Alto tourney. The
 Longhorns=
 =20
 will play No. 2 seed Long Beach State (35-21) in a first-round game Friday
 =20
 at 5 p. m. Texas time (3 p.m. Pacific time) in the double-elimination=20
 tournament.
 Stanford, the top seed at 42-14, will play No. 4 seed Marisa (32-19) in
 the=20
 other first round game Friday.
 The first-round losers will play an elimination game at 1 p.m. Texas
 time=20
 Saturday, with the first-round winners meeting at 5 p.m. Texas time. At
 that=
 =20
 point, one team will be 2-0 and will advance to the finals. The other
 two=20
 surivivors will be 1-1 and will play an elimination game at 9 p.m. Texas
 tim=
 e=20
 Saturday.
 The Saturday night survivor will meet the unbeaten team at 3 p.m. Texas
 time=
 =20
 Sunday. If the unbeaten team  wins, the tourney is over. If it loses, the
 tw=
 o=20
 teams will meet again at 7 p.m. Sunday for the title.
 The 16 survivors of the sub-regionals will meet in two-team super
 regionals=20
 June 1-3 at sites to be determined. All of the super regionals will be
 best=20
 two out of three series.
 Suspended pitcher Albert Montes has rejoined the team after missing the
 Big=20
 12 tourney.
 Big 12 champion Nebraska is seeded No. 1 and is hosting a sub regional.
 Texa=
 s=20
 Tech is a No. 3 seed at Cal State Fullerton. Oklahoma State is a No. 3
 seed=20
 at a sub regional at Tulane. Baylor is a No. 4 seed at Rice, which is
 seeded=
 =20
 No. 1 in its regional.

 Basketball coach Rick Barnes apparently has no plans to add another
 recruit=20
 in the wake of junior forward Maurice Evans' surprising decision to hire
 an=20
 agent, which makes him ineligible to return for his senior year. Evans
 had=20
 said earlier he was going to make himself available for the NBA draft,
 but=20
 Barnes and everyone else expected him to return. By hiring an agent, he
 made=
 =20
 that impossible.
 Evans is a good college player, but, at 6-5, he is not an accomplished=20
 dribbler and there are no 6-5 guys in the NBA who are not accomplished=20
 dribblers. I don't know what he will be doing next basketball season, but
 I=20
 will be shocked if he is playing in the NBA.

 The Longhorn football coaches have wrapped up four weeks of travel and
 talen=
 t=20
 evaluation, and now they are zeroing in on the top prospects they have
 found=
 .
 There are a lot of kids who already are well known, but four players
 really=20
 shot to the top of many college lists during the evaluation period. They
 are=
 =20
 CB Michael Hawkins, 6-1, 180, 4.4, and LB-DE Glenn Jackson, 6-2, 220,
 4.6,=20
 both of Carrollton Turner; OL Tony Ugoh, 6-4, 275, 5.1, of Spring
 Westfield,=
 =20
 and LB-DE Nick Owino, 6-2, 225, 4.6, of Alief Elsik. UT is one of the
 many=20
 schools in hot pursuit of this talented quartet.
 Owino is the lightning quick DE the Longhorns have been searching for
 ever=20
 since this staff arrived and Jackson is lightning quick, too, and might
 wind=
 =20
 up at DE, too.
 I'm not saying they are Tony Brackens, but they have great potential
 and=20
 could develop into that type of player.
 Both head coach Mack Brown and defensive coordinator Carl Reese have
 been=20
 eager to sign some good speed rushers to play DE, and, after studying tape
 o=
 f=20
 both Owino and Jackson, I think they are just what the Longhorns have
 been=20
 seeking.
 The first Longhorn summer camps will start June 2. Some of the top
 recruits=20
 who plan to make one of the early June camps are DTs Earl Anderson of
 San=20
 Marcos and Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale, Arizona, and  CB Donald Burgs
 of=20
 Houston Madison. Sendlein and Burgs are both strong Longhorn leans and
 might=
 =20
 commit early. Anderson also likes the Longhorns, but has said he
 probably=20
 won't commit early.
 LB Andy Matakis of Corpus Christi Flour Bluff is an interesting recruit.
 He=20
 came to Texas as a heralded player from Pennsylvania, but did not have
 a=20
 great season last year, his first in Texas. But he came from a state
 where=20
 below-the-waist blocking is not allowed in high school, and it will be=20
 interesting to see what he does this year after getting accustomed to
 having=
 =20
 people diving at his knees. He is big and fast at 6-3, 225 and 4.6, and
 migh=
 t=20
 blossom into a big-time prospect.
