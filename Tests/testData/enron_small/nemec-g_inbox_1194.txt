Yea, someone should have warned you about the drinks being poured at the
ol' GK.  They tend to be pretty stiff.

...and ..."Swerve on?"  I have only a select group of friends who use such
terminology - you must be one of those cool-guy types!

A night out on Thursday sounds really good right now - maybe I will see
you.  Downing Street is one of my favorite low-key spots - a bit of a meat
market at times, but low key nonetheless.  Not to be rude, but to be
thorough rather, would you describe yourself as blond or more of a
brunette?

Jen

Yea, we definitely had our swerve on that night.  I will have to have a
talk with that bartender next time, because I was over-served.  Probably
not a good idea to start at GK at 6  and stay til 2 in the morning.

Thanks for your gracious response.  Let me tell you, I had much debate over
whether email was the appropriate communication medium or the phone.  I was
swung in favor of email to save myself the potential awkwardness of the
following phone conversation scenario:

     Jennifer:  "Hello"
     Gerald:  "Hi, Jennifer, this is Gerald.  We met at the Gallant Knight
on Friday"
     Jennifer:  "Who?"

As I said Friday night was kind of hazy for me.  I'll probably be meeting
some friends for happy hour on Thursday night at Downing Street.  If you
and your friends are out, why don't you try and stop by.

Gerald.

   Of course I remember you.  GK is really a great spot on Fridays - Looked
   like you guys were having a good time!
   I found you quite nice as well, but I am currently dating someone.  No
   worries.  While I've never been a big fan of unconventional dating
   practices (i.e. hooking up over the internet), i do fancy your approach
   of
   straightforward and clever ingenuity!!  And if you ever want to just
   have
   lunch or a drink anyway, let me know.

   Jen

   P.S.   Tell Mike "no worries"  as well!

   Hi Jennifer,  I don't know if you remember, but we met at Gallant Knight
   on Friday night.  I was with Mike Robison and the Enron group.  I had
   never been there before, but that place is alot of fun.  Definition of
   "Swanky".  You are probably wondering, "Why is this guy emailing me!"
   We'll, I will be straightforward and say that I found you very charming.
   I wanted to see if you would be interested in meeting me for lunch or a
   drink afterwork!  I apologize in advance if you are dating or involved
   with someone, but I thought I would take that chance.

   P.S.  Mike gave me your email address, but don't hold it against him.
   ;-)

   Gerald
