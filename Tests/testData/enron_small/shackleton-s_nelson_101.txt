Sara, do you want me to include on the Brokerage Agreement Report any other 
updates on the futures or other agreements you are working on?  You can 
forward to me and I will make sure it gets added.

Thanx.

Sent for execution on April 6.  Aneela called JP to hurry them along for 
final docs.  You may need to call them as we've not received account 
information.
