I have never seen the language requested before and have not signed off on 
it.  Rob Taylor and I only discussed the concept because I had never seen a 
draft of the Consent until a signed copy was delivered to me yesterday.

This language is different that what GE was told was requested before.  I
am more comfortable going back to GE with what was requested previously.

party beneficiary of this Consent and shall be entitled to enforce its
provisions against GE Packaged Power and GE, respectively, as if a
