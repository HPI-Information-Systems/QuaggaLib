Mark, David;
Enron Corp is expecting 590,609.20 ($463,609.20 + $127,000.00) from ECT.  
Scott Neal wants to see what impact, if any, this will have on the East Desk 
P&L.  I'm hoping we didn't show any of this as East Desk revenue.

Summary
Earlier this year, ECT received a credit from Transco in the amount of 
$463,609.20.  This credit was the result of reallocations on Enron 
Louisiana's PVR replacement contract for 9612 and 9701 production months.  
ECT nominated the replacement gas and paid all transport expense associated 
with this contract.  Scott Neal has agreed to pass this money on to 
corporate.  The net effect to ECT is $0.00.  Enron Corp is also expecting 
$127,000.00.  This is for a similar adjustment ECT received in 1997 that was 
written off on 1998 (see below).  The actual amount for the 1997 adjustment 
is $121,080.16.  

Enron Corp has had a $600,000.00 receivable (from Transcanada) on their books 
since Enron Louisiana was sold to Transcanada.  Enron Corp and Transcanada 
thought Transco was going to send the credits to Transcanada instead of ECT.

Chris,

In order for the I/C imbalance between ECT and ELEC be resolved by August 
month-end close,  a wire or check made payable to Co.366 needs to be prepared 
by the end of this week.  

Please advise me the amount that needs to be made so that I can prepare a 
manual wire/check this week.  I'll contact Inez Haberl regarding the payee's 
bank information.

Thanks,
Vivien

The offsetting dollar amount for the 9612 production adjustment 
(K#016-21045-306C) was $121,080.16.  This adjustment however was reversed 
from Enron Louisiana's account and reclassed to Enron Liquid Services in 
11/97 GL and subsequently written off in 01/98 GL at the time the company was 
sold.  I do have a copy of the write off entry at my desk should you need it.

I've discussed with Darron regarding the difference between the amount we are 
going to make to Co.366 ($463,609.20) and the actual dollars in the system 
($498,824.82).  He thought it would be better for audit trail purpose to 
write off this difference since the volume in the system is correct.  

Chris, please let me know when to prepare the wire/check to Co.366 and what 
the amount would be.  Thanks,

Vivien

The 9612 production adjustment received from Transco was a reduction in 
volume of (33,517).  There was a ($2,734.99) Commodity adjustment and a 
($124,582.69) Cash Out adjustment for a total credit from Transco of 
($127,317.68).  ECT took this credit.  This volume adjustment was entered in 
the sales system in 10/97 reducing the sales volume to Enron Louisiana from 
284,890 to 251,373 on K#016-21045-306C.  I don't know what the offsetting 
dollar amount would be for the sales adjustment but someone in Client 
Services should be able to get this info.

Subject: Enron Louisiana Mtg. 8/3

I spoke with Tracy Geaccone after our meeting yesterday.  Tracy is expecting 
to receive about $590,000.00, the $463,609.20 we discussed in yesterday's 
meeting plus a $127,000.00 adjustment we processed  in mid to late 1997.

Melba told me this morning that  the $127,000.00 was for a 9612 production 
month adjustment.  What I need to know is how this adjustment was applied to 
Enron Louisiana's account, did we 1) write it off, 2)  pass it through to 
some other Enron entity via check, wire transfer, or journal voucher or 3) 
cut a check to Trans Canada?  Who do I talk to about this?

Also, Inez Habel (works for Tracy) said the money should go to company 366.  
Gary, Darron, I believe someone in your group should probably talk to Inez.  
Her extension is 3-7720.

Next question, should we pass on the $463,609.20 to Tracy or should we wait 
until we find out what happened to the $127,000.00?  I believe it depends on 
how long it will take to research the $127,000.00.

Comments, Questions?
