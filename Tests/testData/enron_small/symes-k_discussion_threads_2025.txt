The Integrated Solutions Center (ISC) has received recommendations from you=
,=20
our eHRonline users, on ways we might improve the time entry process as it=
=20
relates to holiday pay.  Based upon these suggestions, the ISC is=20
implementing a new time entry process to record holiday time, which is=20
effective immediately, beginning with the February 16-28, 2001, time-entry=
=20
period. =20

Holiday pay for all eligible employees must be entered as =01&Company Obser=
ved=20
Holiday=018, and the recent company-observed holiday of President=01,s Day =
(Monday,=20
February 19, 2001) must be coded =01&Company Observed Holiday=018.  However=
, if you=01,
re an employee who works a 12-hour shift schedule, there are no changes to=
=20
your time entry process for Holiday pay.  Please continue to record your=20
holiday time in the usual manner.

If you=01,re a salaried, non-exempt employee and you work a holiday, you mu=
st=20
enter =01&Company Observed Holiday=018 for that holiday and enter =01&Regul=
ar Work=20
Time=018 for all hours worked on the holiday to ensure proper payment of=20
overtime for the day. =20

Discretionary holiday time has been limited to eight (8) hours for all=20
eligible employees, per the Enron Policy on Work Hours/Holidays/Vacation (<
http://hrweb.enron.com/policyandprocedure/docs/12-hours.pdf>).   eHRonline=
=20
will not allow you to record more than eight (8) hours per calendar year=20
under the =01&Discretionary Holiday=018 time-entry code. =20

Detailed instructions on coding holiday time are available within SAP=20
eHRonline Process Bulletin HR -01-04, which can be accesed through the=20
following link: =20

If you have questions regarding this new eHRonline functionality, please=20
contact the ISC Call Center at (713) 345-4SAP (4727).  Questions about the=
=20
Enron Policy on Work Hours/Holidays/Vacation should be directed to your Hum=

Resources representative.
