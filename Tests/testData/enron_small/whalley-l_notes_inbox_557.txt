Today, we received a letter from FERC notifying us that they are initiating 
an inquiry to increase "their understanding of the scope and development of 
electronic trading in electric power and natural gas markets."   FERC is 
requesting that EnronOnline "cooperate" with the inquiry.  The letter states 
that they will be sending us a request for information, and visiting our 
offices in Houston.  

We're not certain what FERC is after with this inquiry, but wanted to make 
sure you were aware of this development.   We are looking into this, and will 
get back to you asap with further information.
