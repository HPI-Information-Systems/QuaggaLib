 Rob,
After discussion with one of our folks, who has experience with the CEQA
process, we feel that the narrative should provide what you need for our
part in the CEQA process.  If you need additional information regarding
this, please contact Mr. Gaylen Raymond at (559) 263-5239.
By the way, do we have a tentative date to meet again for around
mid-December? I will not be available on Fridays in Dec.
Don Fantz
