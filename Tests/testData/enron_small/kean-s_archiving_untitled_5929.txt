Looks fine as far as it goes ... but don't we want to explain how this fits 
in to our strategy?  Is it just another platform for us to bring our products 
and prices to the market?  We have said with respect to EOL that the 
transaction is the goal not the platform.  Do we want to position this the 
same way?  Examples of other press releases include our extension of pricing 
on EOL to the two other platforms (including Houston Street) which we did a 
couple of months ago.

		 Subject: Envera Release

Enron Global Markets (EGM) has entered into a cooperative agreement with 
Envera, a B2B network for the chemical and petrochemical industry.  As part 
of this agreement  EGM will receive an equity interest in Envera.  The 
contract allows Envera to issue a press release, subject to our approval.  
Attached for your review and comment is the proposed release.  This release 
has been heavily scrubbed.  It is significantly less exposure than in their 
initial proposals.  Your early approval would be appreciated.

John
