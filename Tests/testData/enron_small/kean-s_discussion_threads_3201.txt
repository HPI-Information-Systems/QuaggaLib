The presentation looks fine but consider adding this idea in a few slides:  
the continuation of a regulated structure poses considerable risk for 
utilities.  California's utilities were pushed to the brink of, or into, 
bankruptcy because of a regualtory regime which allocated price risk to 
them.  All parties are better off in a system where the regulated enterprise 
is limited to natural monopoly functions and all other acitivities are 
conducted in a marketplace.

Also, did we cover the shortcomings of the Japanese market sufficiently?
