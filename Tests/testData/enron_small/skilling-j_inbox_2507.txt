Hi Jeffrey,

The launch party for the Houston Entrepreneurs Foundation is only 1 week away.   The event is at Ruggles, Enron Field in the late afternoon/evening of November 14.  We expect it to be a fun event and hope that you will join us. Below is a link where you can find out more details about the event and a form to RSVP.

We look forward to seeing you on the 14th!
