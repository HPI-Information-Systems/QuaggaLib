My trip has been postponed so I will be in the balance of the week.

I would like to secure an affadavit(s) from payroll (stating he was not our 
employee) and human resources (stating no employment file exists for this 
gentlemen and that no employee benefits were offered/paid to him).  Is this 
something that you can assist me in obtaining or would you prefer I work with 
our Litigation Unit in order to obtain? 

In the meantime, I am writing back to the attorney requesting the Wyoming 
cases he is relying upon.  Also, I am going to request his clients damages as 
a result of this incident and a copy of their commercial auto policy.  Thanks,

Rob

Shonnie, I am faxing you another letter received from the attorney for the 
other party.  I will call you sometime next week in order to formulate an 
appropriate response as I am leaving the office momentarily until next week.  
Thanks,

Rob
