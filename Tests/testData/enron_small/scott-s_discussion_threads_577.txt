From astrology.com (must I beware of overindulgence in such websites?)
I like the part about charm and charisma and think it is very true.

Sagittarius and Sagittarius
When two Sagittarians join together in a love match, the truth-loving
natures
makes theirs a near perfect relationship. This couple views the world around
them with an educated eye and both share an intense hunger for more
knowledge. They will engage one another in pleasant conversation and
banter that challenges and tickles the mind.  An occasional hotheaded
dispute
can erupt in the Sagittarius-Sagittarius relationship, when one fact-fanatic
Sag
partner carries things a little too far. Easygoing and independent, these
two are
compatible when it comes to balancing personal interests. They've never
known
jealousy, and each partner keeps busy with personal projects when not with
their
lover. When they are together, however, they do all they can toward pleasing
their partner and satiating common interests.  Although they are adaptable
and
modern, they can, at times, fly off the handle. However, it is not in the
Archer's
nature to hold a grudge or let disagreements fester very long.

Sagittarius is ruled by the Planet Jupiter (Luck). Expansion is the key word
here;
as both partners enjoy the acquisition of knowledge, they will carry over
exciting
ideas into their relationship. They must be mindful of over-indulgences, as
such
gluttony will only distract them. Their charm and charisma make them a very
pleasant couple not only to one another, but the entire crowd.
