RAC came by and brought up a couple of concerns.  1- the Var on this deal is 
over $120m (more than all of ENE combined); they wanted to make me aware of 
the size, and they know we are working on it. and 2 - EE&CC; they were 
concerned about them doing the deal and their abilities and effects on MTM 
treatment.  I told them that they can bid on it but we want others to bid and 
that we probably won't use them.  They stated that the deal guys are acting 
like EE&CC is a done deal.

Lets discuss.
Thanks,
mike
