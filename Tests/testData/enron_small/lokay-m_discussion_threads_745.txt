In an effort to bring incremental revenue for our pipeline, I researched 
outstanding invoices generated from facility interconnects, etc.  
Transwestern currently has no outstanding dollars to collect.  However, there 
appears to be $600,000 that can be collected on Northern Natural in addition 
to $250,000 that was written off.  Attached are the spreadsheets from 
Accounts Receivable.
