I suggest that you all start without me.  I'm going to be absent for the
next 2
weeks with the competition, work and vacation.  After that time, I'll be
ready
to do whatever needs to be done.

When would everyone like to get together to discuss?  Maybe we could all do
a little research and then meet (or conference call) early next week to
divide and conquer.

Greetings Professor:

Our group consists of Jeff Dasovich, Mark Guinney, Anil Sama and Carolyn
Vavrek.

We propose to examine the recently failed acquisition by Coke of Quaker
Oats:  Why merge?  What was the value?  Upside?  Downside?  Why did it go
bust?  Should it have gone through?  What's up with this Buffet guy,
anyway?

If you have any concerns with this proposal, please let us know.

Finally, if possible, we'd like to present on Thursday, April 26th.

Best,
Jeff
