Your summary is correct based on information to date (in this regard the 
agreement between ENA and EEFT still requires amendment in respect of RMT and 
I undertake to get this done). 

However, please note that there have been some last minute changes in the 
Japanese tax advice, received I understand only as of last night. Susan Musch 
will be following up on these changes at a meeting today with Sheila Glover 
and Darren Delage, and has undertaken to keep you appraised of the position. 
The effect of the change would be to permit RMT to be the principal for the 
Japanese FX desk, with a Japanese entity acting as agent to arrange the 
transactions. 

Best regards
Janine

Janine:

With respect to the attached (internal) FX product for EOL, I just wanted to 
verify with you that internal counterparties should transact on EOL with:

(1)  RMT  (as principal for Houston FX desk)

(2)  EEFT as agent for RMT (as principal for London FX desk).  In this 
regard, was the services agreement between ENA and EEFT ever extended to 
include RMT for internal trades? 

(3)  Enron Japan Corp. (as principal for Tokyo FX desk)

There appears to be some confusion since our meeting of November 3.  Thanks.  
Sara
