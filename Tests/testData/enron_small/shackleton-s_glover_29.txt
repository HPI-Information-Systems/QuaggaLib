We are going to use 76-0486649 for the tax id for Enron Distribution 
Ventures.  This is the number of Atlantic Commercial Finance, Inc., the 
parent of Enron Distribution Ventures.  See tax department e-mail traffic 
below.  If the brokerage firm has a problem with this, I guess we will need 
to put our tax people in touch with their legal department.  We can't undo 
our tax treatment just to satisfy the brokerage firm.

Lauren,
The answer was pretty straight forward, a disregarded entity uses the 
Employer ID# of is single-member owner, in this case ACFI (Federal ID #:  
76-0486649).  Fortunately, Cullen is a walking/talking tax code ... he amazes 
me!

Reg. o 301-6109-1(h)(2)(i) seems pretty clear to me that a disregarded entity 
uses its single member's EIN.

Subject: Have You Needed EIN for 'Disregarded' Entity?

Enron India LLC (EILLC) is a 'disregarded' sub of Atlantic Commercial 
Finance, Inc. (ACFI).  Both are US entities.
EILLC has today opened a US brokerage account and was asked to furnish its 
EIN on form W-9, Request for Txpr ID#.  

Query:  Do any of you have prior experience with determining whether EILLC 
can simply supply the EIN of ACFI or whether EILLC must apply for its own 
EIN?  If yes, how was your issue resolved?

Annette Glod will check with the Service tomorrow and will be glad to report 
back to this group with the answer.
