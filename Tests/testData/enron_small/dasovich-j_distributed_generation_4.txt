I wanted to bring to this group's attention the Maryland PSC staff's commen=
ts=20
regarding BGE's standby service proposal.  The proposal in its current form=
=20
is a result of numerous settlement meetings among BGE, staff, Enron, Trigen=
=20
(a developer of on-site generation), and several large industrial customers=
. =20

In staff's comments, it talks about the DG-related issues raised -- but not=
=20
addressed -- by BGE's filing, and it encourages the Commission to adopt=20
state-wide policies to promote a vibrant competitive market for DG=20
services.   Harry -- it appears that our many hours spent educating the sta=
ff=20
(and others) on DG issues was well worth the time.   Significantly, staff=
=20
states in its comments that: =20

"A third issue that can impact the adoption of DG services is that of=20
interconnection policies.  Interconnection policy differences between the=
=20
IOUs (statewide) can significantly retard the development of a vibrant DG=
=20
industry for services to customers.  As with other aspects of electric=20
restructuring, Staff believes that common accepted rules that have statewid=
e=20
applicability will promote electric services competition.  Hence, the=20
adoption of =01&one=018 set of interconnection standards could provide a go=
od=20
incentive for developing a DG services market in Maryland.  Staff believes=
=20
that eventually, the State of Maryland may need to adopt 'a proposed' set o=
f=20
interconnection standards that apply Statewide."

Further, staff talks about the benefits of DG:

"Increasing the use of DG services could help Customers by decreasing their=
=20
costs and adding flexibility to their use of electricity services.  Some=20
parties could argue that increasing use of DG would also help BGE and allow=
=20
it to avoid unneeded investments in T&D.  The net result would provide=20
greater diversity of demand in the wire delivery system and improve overall=
=20
electricity service efficiency.   Staff is of the opinion that a fuller=20
adoption of DG services is a positive development, which can provide benefi=
ts=20
to customers of BGE as well as the IOUs, in terms of avoided (and perhaps=
=20
unnecessary) investments in T&D, and also provide benefits to the State of=
=20
Maryland in terms of a more efficient electric service industry, including=
=20
environmental benefits."=20

Please let me know if you would like a copy of BGE's standby filing.
