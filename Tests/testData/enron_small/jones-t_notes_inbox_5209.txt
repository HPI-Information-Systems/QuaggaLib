BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive=
=20
response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and=
=20
interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were=
=20
quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new=20
sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis an=
d=20
Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha=20
(financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market=
=20
analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securitie=
s=20
Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions=
=20
using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch fo=
r=20
e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual=
=20
desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000=
=20
hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic=20
databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line=
=20
research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of informati=
on=20
explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's=
=20
research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant=20
database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to furthe=
r=20
fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to=
=20
good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university=
=20
libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This=
=20
should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical=
=20
research needs.=20

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference,=20
Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented=
=20
itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center=
=20
capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via t=
he=20
user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil=
=20
and others were duly impressed. =20

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website,=20
http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greate=
r=20
functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like "Industry=
=20
Overviews" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Countr=
y=20
Watch, and World Energy Markets.
