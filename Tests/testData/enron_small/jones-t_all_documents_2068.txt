I just spoke to Mark Taylor and he has requested that we be more specific 
about the nature of the project we are working on in our confidentiality 
agreements.  On a going forward basis can you please provide that information 
along with the other info you give me.  Thanks!

I will be out of the office Monday and Tuesday.  If you have a RUSH 
Confidentiality Agreement that can't wait until Wednesday, call Mark Taylor 
at x37459 and he will find someone else in our Group to prepare it.

Louise, don't worry about Continental.  Mark is working on getting it signed 
in my absence!
