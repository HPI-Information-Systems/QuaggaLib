Please pass this message on to Hartsoe and others as well.  Meeting went=20
until 12:15 PM.  He=01,s not going into details now.   During the course of=
 the=20
day there were several meetings and a proposal.  There was sort of an=20
agreement =01) I wouldn=01,t say it was a conceptual agreement that was rea=
ched=20
among the parties that is going to be released by Treasury today.  I=01,m n=
ot=20
sure much will come of it.  It=01,s going to create some motion.  I talked =
to=20
Sue Mara.  Sue will be coming over to the office and you=01,ll need someone=
 else=20
to go with her because of the fact there are two working groups instead of=
=20
one.  I=01,m going to read to you the statement:

The Governor of CA and a bipartisan leadership of the state legislature met=
=20
with major generators including qualifying facilities, marketers, utility=
=20
regulators and federal officials to discuss the electricity situation in CA=
. =20
Recognizing the importance of the issue as laid out in the Governor=01,s St=
ate=20
of the State speech last evening, the partipants agreed for the need for=20
cooperation to maintain stability and avoid bankruptcy for the utilities an=
d=20
assure the long term regulation of market conditions.  Crucial elements of=
=20
the solution include: =20

? The development of approaches to promote long-term purchases of electrici=
ty=20
possibily by States and generators at an attractive fixed rate - an=20
option-type of an idea perhaps using some type of existing state agency lik=
e=20
DWR - Dept. of Water and Resources to basically create the credit and=20
insulation for suppliers from the utilities.

? The willingness for generators, qualifying facilities and markets to=20
provide on the short-term basis for current amounts owed by PGE and Edison =
in=20
the context of the framework of a long-term solution

? The need to find satisfactory approaches with respect to the obligation=
=20
accumulation of the utilitles for the purchase of power consistent with=20
contractual obligations and which are in the public interest.

? Cooperation to better match supply and demand in the short and long-term.

? Review of the existing qualifying facilities payments to directors.

The parties ackknoweldge the problem must be addresed while taking into=20
account the regional market.  Further working groups will be convened on=20
Wednesday, and there will be two working groups to address to address=20
technical details.  Principals will reconvene this weekend.  One working=20
group will deal with long-term auction and QF issues.  The first and the la=
st=20
bullets and the second and the third bullets which have to do more with the=
=20
arrearages, the debt and the obligations that have been accumulated for the=
=20
purchase of the power is the second  working group. =20

I think I=01,ve read it all.  The working groups (see first and last bullet=
s)=20
Sue is best equipped to handle.  If we need to send another person over wit=
h=20
Sue to sit on the second working group that deals with the unrecovered and=
=20
unpaid obligations of the utilites.  Sarah Novosel should do that. =20
