Thank you for taking  the time to speak with me this evening about the 
Xcelerator.? I enjoyed our  conversation and particularly appreciated your 
candor.? It sounds like the  Xcelerator, structured carefully, could be an 
exciting place to be.? Please  feel free to contact me if you would like to 
discuss this  further.
?
Thanks  again.
