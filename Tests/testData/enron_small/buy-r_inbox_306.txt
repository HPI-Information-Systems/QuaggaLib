You're sending biz e-mails at 7:30 on Saturday morning?  You must have kids---at any rate, thanks for the note.  Am glad things worked out well and that you were so flexible re: scheduling---let me know if you need anything going forward (as I assume you will be)---and if I don't talk to you, (try to) have a terrific holiday!
