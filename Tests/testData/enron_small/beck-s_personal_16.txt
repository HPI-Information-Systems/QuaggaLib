Everything sounds good, but can we use .html instead? .htm doesn't work on
Linux web servers, and it's best to be universal, in case they want to
deploy in diff. contexts.

So that we can avoid last minute "oh my gosh we've used different file
structures/naming convention--quick we need to change all of these paths in
the next ten minutes", can we do the following?

All html files will be considered as in the root directory and will use the
extension of ".htm"

Subdirectories/folders:

images--images for Sales Guide and Intro and any image that is used
throughout the deliverable, such as logos, navigation buttons, etc.  So an
example would  be: images/dell_logo.gif

scripts--one script folder for all of the Coursebuilder scripts used in the
deliverable

timer--for the timer interaction that Daniel is building

images/mollie--for images specific to Mollie pages (this way if we have more
than one drag/drop we won't have to rename any Coursebuilder created
images/targets, etc.

images/warren

images/sally

images/david

Will this work for everyone?  If not, please let me know and I will send out
modifications.

Cindy
