      Louise,
      I just talked to Fernando Sanchez Ugarte, Chairman of CFC (Federal Competition Commission),  and told him of our urgency
      to have our request approved in the next two weeks.
      He told me he will look into it today and will try to have it resolved asap. Our lawyers should do the follow up, but I am 
      confident we will get it done in time.
      Regards,   Jaime_____
