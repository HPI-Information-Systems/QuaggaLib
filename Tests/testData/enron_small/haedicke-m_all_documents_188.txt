Dear Terry:

Thanks for your quick reply.  Wednesday at 2 PM works for me.  I would be 
happy to come to IBJ's offices.  I will be joined by two others on our team.  
I would propose to discuss the prospects and challenges for energy trading in 
Japan.  Let me know if this is OK with you.   Look foward to seeing you.

Regards,

Mark
