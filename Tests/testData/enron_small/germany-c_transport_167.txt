Molly - Chris Germany preferred to have new deals for these.  These are 
necessary due to there being two different transportation adjustments for the 
producers' group of meters (points).  The existing deals are OK for certain 
meters, but new deals are needed for the other meters.  Please modify 
existing deals and provide new deals as follows:

       Meter(Point)
Producer  Prod Dates Deal#  These Only 
Pricing
