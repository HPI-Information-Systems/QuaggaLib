PLEASE SUBMIT BY 12:00 NOON ON MONDAY, JULY 16, 2001


Only submit your timesheet if you have exceptional time, or if your rotation information has changed.

 Sorry, we are no longer tracking overtime since you are salary based. 


To all A/A Pool members: 

?	It is important to inform us if you have exceptional time.

?	To those members who are submitting time to your assistant, please make sure the assistant forwards
this information on to the A/A program. 

?	With the Roll-Out of SAP, you have the ability to go on-line @ http://ehronline.enron.com/ and input your time. 


I will continue to email for timesheets regardless if you go on-line. 

This memo is to inform you to complete your timesheet.


Quick Reminder: 

 You may receive your present or previous paychecks @ EB 3539A
 (if delivery is not set-up to your location/mail stop). 


Thank You for Your Cooperation
