Hi Aleck:  How did your talk go?  I hope well.  If you're refering to the PX 
study on whether to have an "as-bid" or "single-price" auction, the PX is in 
the preliminary stages of having a report prepared.  What they've done is 
assemble a "Blue Ribbon" panel of economists (as reported in the press 
accounts you've seen) to examine the issue and report back.  I'm not aware of 
a report having yet been completed by the panel and submitted to the PX.  
Have you heard differently?  I'll poke around.

Best,
Jeff
