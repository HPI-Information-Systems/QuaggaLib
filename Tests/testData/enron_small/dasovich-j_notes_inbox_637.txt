Dear Poolsters,

I just want you all to know that I, Cameron's boyfriend, the guy who is
behind Cameron's picks (save when we came in #1 last week, when I was out of
town, and Cameron did the picks -- an accomplishment slightly embarrassing,
but wonderful all the same) and the same guy who moved to San Francisco for
Cameron (or for our relationship), and, upon my arrival, pledged my loyalty
-- in front of the whole Sellers' family, hand on Bible -- to the 49ers (it
was easier when Steve Young retired, for Cameron told me that he was the
only man she would ever leave me for... Gosh I love Jeff Garcia!)... Yes
this same guy was begging for Cameron to take the 49ers against Dallas.
Begging. Entrapped by the hubris of winning last week, she refused my
advise. So, we ended up in 3rd. Oh well. Things could be worse. I just
wonder, maybe this is the sign of a true fan, someone who refuses to pick
the 49ers for fear that the heart's involved... Nah, I'll still pick 'em,
even if I have to beg. Good luck to all, and go 49ers!
