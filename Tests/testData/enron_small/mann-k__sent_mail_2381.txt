My only warning is that working for Sheila is that she takes over most of the 
big stuff, even if it is your deal. Everything that she is working on now was 
one of her lawyers' deals, but "things just weren't getting done".  She can 
be very unclear in what she expects from you.  She is the ultimate 
micro-manager.  She may hire the outside counsel on "your" deal, then tell 
you about it later, not consulting you to find out who you want to use.   
This style may not bother you, as you may in fact get comfort from working 
closely with someone.  Clearly, she has a lot of experience to impart, and 
she is very, very nice.  

I'm sure there will be a downside to working with Jeff and Barbara, I just 
haven't been in the group long enough to have an opinion.

PS.  I thought this time I would give you full disclosure...
