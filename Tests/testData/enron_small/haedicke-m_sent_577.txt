The term "cruelty" as used in the statute is not unconstitutionally vague=

because it gives fair notice to a person of ordinary intelligence and a=20
reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited or required. In this case=

Issues: Denial of defense motion for a lineup; Prosecutorial misconduct
Court: Michigan Court of Appeals (Unpublished)
Case Name: People v. Cain
e-Journal Number: 8381
Judge(s): Per Curiam - Neff, Talbot, and Sullivan

The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendant's=20
untimely motion for a lineup. An eyewitness testified that she was only an=
=20
arm's length away from defendant when she saw him "key" the complainant's=
=20
vehicle, then enter a business. The manager of the business, notified of th=
e=20
keying incident shortly after it occurred, testified that defendant was the=
=20
only person in the building lobby matching the perpetrator's description.=
=20
Although eyewitness identification was a material issue, a lineup would not=
=20
have resolved any "mistaken identification" in this case. The trial court=
=20
also properly considered the untimeliness of the motion, and the possible=
=20
hardship a delay for a lineup could have had on the eyewitness, who resided=
=20
in another state. Defendant's conviction of malicious destruction of proper=
ty=20
over $100 was affirmed.

Court: Michigan Court of Appeals (Unpublished)
Case Name: People v. Fordham
e-Journal Number: 8380
Judge(s): Per Curiam - Neff, Talbot, and Sullivan

Since both the victim and a police officer identified the defendant as the=
=20
man who stole the victim's car and the trial court concluded that the victi=
m=20
was not confused when he identified the defendant as the carjacker, the tri=
al=20
court's finding that defendant was one of the carjackers was not clearly=20
erroneous. There was sufficient evidence based on the identification eviden=
ce=20
for a rational trier of fact to have concluded that defendant committed the=

carjacking. Affirmed.=20

Issues: Sufficient evidence of intent to convict for arson of a dwelling=20

intent
Court: Michigan Court of Appeals (Unpublished)
Case Name: People v. Moss
e-Journal Number: 8387
Judge(s): Per Curiam - Neff, Talbot, and Sullivan

The prosecution introduced sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact=
=20
to conclude that defendant acted willfully and maliciously, regardless of=
=20
whether he was intoxicated to some degree, when he set fire to the victims'=
=20
home. Even if defendant was drunk when arrested approximately 22 hours afte=
r=20
the fire, his intoxication did not bear any relation to his state of mind o=
n=20
the night of the fire. The testimony indicated that even if defendant was=
=20
intoxicated, he remained fully capable of entertaining the necessary specif=
ic=20
intent. The evidence established that (1) defendant appeared at the victims=
'=20
home three times and was there purposely prior to the fire, (2) defendant h=
ad=20
no reported difficulty safely traveling to and from the victims' house, (3)=
=20
defendant threatened the victims that he would return to harm them, and (4)=
=20
defendant followed through with the threats later that night when he=20
purchased kerosene, transported it to the victims' home, poured it onto the=
=20
porch and into the mail slot, and set fire to the home. Affirmed.

Court: Michigan Court of Appeals (Unpublished)
Case Name: People v. Pitts
e-Journal Number: 8395
Judge(s): Per Curiam - Neff, Talbot, and Sullivan

There was insufficient evidence that defendant performed acts or gave=20
encouragement that assisted the commission of the crimes to support his=20
convictions for aiding and abetting false pretenses and attempted false=20
pretenses. Although defendant threw torn pieces of paper from the passenger=
=20
door of the vehicle during the pursuit by the police, the credit card numbe=
rs=20
recovered from the torn pieces of paper were not similar to the credit card=
=20
numbers given by defendant's brother to purchase merchandise. There was no=

evidence associating defendant with the representations that were made to t=
he=20
employees by his brother regarding the validity of the credit card numbers.=

Issues: Suppression of defendant's inculpatory statements; Whether=20
interrogation was custodial; Whether defendant's statements were knowingly=
=20
and voluntarily made; Totality of the circumstances
Court: Michigan Court of Appeals (Unpublished)
Case Name: People v. Rose
e-Journal Number: 8385
Judge(s): Per Curiam - McDonald, Sawyer, and White

The trial court erred in suppressing defendant's statements to police on th=
e=20
basis that defendant was in custody and thus entitled to Miranda warnings=
=20
from the outset of the interview. Defendant agreed to speak with the police=
,=20
drove himself to the station, and was informed prior to the interview that =
he=20
was not under arrest and was free to leave. At no time was he told that he=
=20
was not free to leave, and the door was left open. The officer's failure to=
=20
tell defendant that he was being investigated for CSC did not alter the fac=
t=20
that defendant was told he was free to leave, or render the interview a=20
custodial one. Further, under the totality of the circumstances, defendant'=
s=20
statements were knowingly and voluntarily made, and were not the product of=
=20
psychological coercion. Defendant was 21-years old, had completed three yea=
rs=20
of college, and discerned the focus of the officer's inquiries soon after t=
he=20
interview began. The trial court's order suppressing defendant's statements=
=20
was reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings.

Court: Michigan Court of Appeals (Unpublished)
Case Name: People v. Vaughn
e-Journal Number: 8383
Judge(s): Per Curiam - O'Connell, Kelly, and Whitbeck

Although the defendant argued that the prosecutor improperly referred to an=
=20
accomplice's plea agreement to bolster that witness' testimony, defendant d=
id=20
not show that he was prejudiced. The prosecutor did not engage in misconduc=
t=20
by eliciting testimony and arguing that the plea agreement required the=20
witness to testify truthfully, because the prosecutor did not personally=20

Court: Michigan Court of Appeals (Unpublished)
Case Name: Belgiorno v. Belgiorno
e-Journal Number: 8389
Judge(s): Per Curiam - Wilder, Smolenski, and Whitbeck

The trial court erred because it did not conduct an evidentiary hearing=20
before it entered an order modifying the parties' custody. The trial court'=
s=20
order placing physical custody of the parties' minor child with=20
plaintiff-mother was vacated and remanded to (1) conduct an evidentiary=20

e-Journal Number: 8379
Judge(s): Per Curiam - Neff, Talbot, and Sullivan

The family court did not err in finding that statutory grounds for=20
termination of respondent-mother's parental rights were established by clea=
r=20
and convincing evidence. Respondent did not begin to work on her treatment=
=20
plan until approximately one month before the termination hearings. Further=
,=20
while she was required to seek substance abuse treatment or submit to drug=
=20
testing, she failed to do either. Since respondent made no significant=20

parental rights were properly terminated under oo 19b(3)(c)(i), (g), and (j=

Court: Michigan Court of Appeals (Unpublished)
Case Name: In re Keller
e-Journal Number: 8378
Judge(s): Per Curiam - Fitzgerald, Hood, and McDonald

The termination of respondent-father's parental rights was reversed because=
=20
the trial court erred by finding that o 51(6)(a) was satisfied on the basis=

that respondent had the ability to pay child support and failed to do so. I=

Gaming Control Bd.
Court: U.S. Court of Appeals Sixth Circuit
Case Name: Barden Detroit Casino, L.L.C. v. The City of Detroit
e-Journal Number: 8399
Judge(s): Nelson, Moore, and Wilhoit

The district court correctly dismissed plaintiff's suit against both the ci=
ty=20
and state defendants because plaintiff, an unsuccessful bidder for a licens=
e=20
to operate a Detroit casino, lacked standing. The court in Lac Vieux=20
previously held that the state law preference exempting certain preferred=
=20
developers from the competitive bidding process and allowing a tie-breaking=
=20
preference for applicants that had supported the initiative legalizing casi=
no=20
gambling in Detroit had been eliminated. Since the preference was=20
ineffective, there could be no injury and no case or controversy against th=
e=20
state defendants in regard to the state statute. As to the city defendants,=
=20
the mayor unequivocally testified that no preference was applied at any sta=
ge=20
of the competitive selection process until after plaintiff had already been=
=20
eliminated from the competition. Therefore, the preference was never applie=
d=20
to plaintiff's detriment, and plaintiff suffered no actual injury. Affirmed=

Court: Michigan Court of Appeals (Unpublished)
Case Name: Cabell v. Carino
e-Journal Number: 8382
Judge(s): Per Curiam - McDonald, Sawyer, and White

The trial court properly granted defendant-orthopedist summary disposition =
on=20
the grounds that plaintiff's pre-suit notice was not filed within two years=
=20
of the act or omission that was the basis of the claim. While plaintiff's=

Court: Michigan Court of Appeals (Unpublished)
Case Name: White v. Department of Agric.
e-Journal Number: 8393
Judge(s): Per Curiam - Owens, Jansen, and Burns

The magistrate properly determined that although an incident where=20
plaintiff's supervisor kicked him to wake plaintiff up after he nodded off =
on=20
the job may have appeared objectively insignificant to the average person,=
=20
there was substantial evidence from plaintiff's physician establishing that=

because it would not take much of a stimulus to trigger a response in a=20
patient with a preexisting borderline personality, the kicking incident=20
contributed to, aggravated, or accelerated plaintiff's mental condition in =
a=20
significant manner. All that is statutorily required are actual events of=

employment, even if objectively unimportant, that contribute to, aggravate,=
