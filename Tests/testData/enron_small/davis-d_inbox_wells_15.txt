Just a word to let you know that Open House has been rescheduled for Oct. 3.  Not sure of the time yet.

Also, this is the last week of the six weeks, so the kids only have until Friday to get make-up work turned in to me.  If you have not signed and returned a letter stating that your child has received his/her grammar textbook, please be sure you get that letter returned to me by Friday.  I did count it as a grade, so your child will receive a zero unless I have something from you stating this.

I updated their grades this weekend, so if you would like to know your child's current status, feel free to ask ...
