Subject: Randy Gay's Wife

Just in case you did not know, Randy's wife died last week. They will be 
having services today and tomorrow.  However, in lieu of flowers they would 
like donations for a playground in their neighborhood.  If you want to give a 
donation, please bring it by my desk.


Thanks
Kimberly
