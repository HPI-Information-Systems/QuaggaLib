I am finalizing the negotiation of the ISDA Master Agreement with SITA.  You 
will recall that this is an ECTRIC; master NOT ENA.  SITA has (1) requested 
evidence of EEFT's ability to sign for ECTRIC and (2) confirmation that "EEFT 
is signing on the basis of their authority under the investment services 
directive".  Would you please provide directly to SITA's lawyers as follows:

Susan Hopkinson and Sharon Lewis at Lovells in Paris:

sharon.lewis@lovells.com

If you require phone or fax:

Tel:  33 1 53 67 47 47
Fax:  33 1 47 23 96 12

Please let me know when you have satisfied this request.  Thanks.  Sara
