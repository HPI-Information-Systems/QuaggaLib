My niece sent this today...got a good laugh from it!

Liz

A lady stopped unexpectedly by her recently married son's house.  She rang
the doorbell and stepped into the house to see her daughter-in-law standing
naked by the door.
"What are you doing?" she asked.
"I am waiting for my husband to come home from work," the daughter-in-law
replied.
"Why are you naked?" asked the mother-in-law.
"This is my love dress," the daughter-in-law replied.
"LOVE DRESS! You're naked," said the mother-in-law.
"But my husband loves it when I wear this dress. It makes him happy and he
makes me happy," said the  daughter-in-law "He will be home any minute now,
so perhaps you could stop by a little later?"
Soured by all of this romantic stuff, the mother-in-law left.
On the way home, she thought about the "LOVE DRESS" and got an idea. She
undressed, showered, applied her best perfume, and waited by the door for
her husband to come home.
Finally, his pickup truck drove up the drive way. Her husband opened the
door, and immediately saw his naked wife.
"What are you doing?" he asked.
"This is my love dress." She said, excitedly.
"Needs ironing." He replied.
