Here is a good example of exactly what I was talking about in our EEI/WSPP =
comparison session yesterday.  Today and tomorrow the WSPP contract committ=
ee is meeting in a palatial setting in southern California, many Club Membe=
rs taking two and a half days off from their "busy" schedules to go there, =
AG warnings of terrorism threats notwithstanding, and, what are they doing?=
  they are discussing another piece of the EEI agreement and deciding wheth=
er or not to adopt it, (which they will in a botched up form)  this particu=
lar item is a Collateral Annex document, designed to strengthen the margin =
taking aspect of the WSPP agreement.  Nobody can complain that this topic i=
s not a relevant topic,  but,  what nobody seems to be noticing, as the yea=
rs go by, is that this catch up side show by these guys is a big waste of t=
he industry's time and money, and, the whole thing could be brought to a ti=
dy ending by a Joint WSPP/EEI drafting Committee.  Why should the market be=
 confused by having two agreements, one of which is forever amending itself=
 to look ever more and more like the other, all the while pretending to be =
vitally and significantly different?  The WSPP is like the Emperor's new cl=
othes story.  It is proudly standing up there in front of the world but it =
has nothing on,  it looks ever more like the very agreement it tries to be =
different from.  This fundamental absurdity of creeping imitation needs to =
be recognized for what it is. This really is our biggest beef against the W=
SPP:  CREEPING IMITATION.   As mid-marketers, you could begin planting the =
seed of the idea, (couching it all in very positive remarks about the wonde=
rful efforts of the WSPP),  that we have made enought progress now and that=
 the time for merger is upon us.  The solution is a joint drafting committe=
e to harmonize the agreements once and for all.    If enough counterparties=
 began talking about this, it might happen.  If we, as Enron lawyers bring =
it up,  we are sarcastically dismissed for being cruel and unusual punisher=
s of Mike Small.   Please think about this and factor it into your conversa=
tions with counterparties. While you are doing that, we lawyers will have t=
he pleasure of another four to 6 hours of phone conference work as the comm=
ittee toils on, the comic and absurd road show entering at least its 4th ye=
ar of this debacle.   ----cgy

This is Reliant's version - while I haven't read it I'm sure it is the best=
 proposal yet.
