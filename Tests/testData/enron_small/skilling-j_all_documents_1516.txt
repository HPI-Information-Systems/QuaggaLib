Erica, Jeff is currently scheduled to be on vacation July 19.  Would it be

Thanks,

Subject: Telephone Call with Jerry Murdock


Dear Mr. Skilling:

I write on behalf of Jerry Murdock, who is currently in Europe.  Mr. Murdock
asked me to pass on the following information regarding your telephone call
scheduled for 10:00am (CST) on Tuesday, May 15.

Insight Capital hosts a quarterly dinner with Robert Rubin and Steve
Friedman and other selected guests.  Our next dinner is scheduled for July
19 and will be held in Aspen, Colorado.  The Current State of the Global
Market will be one of the topics under discussion and Jack Welch of GE is
one of your fellow invitees.

The purpose of your conversation with Mr. Murdock is to discuss the above in
more detail and to more fully brief you on the purpose of these dinners.

Please do not hesitate to contact me should you require any further
information.

Erica Harris
