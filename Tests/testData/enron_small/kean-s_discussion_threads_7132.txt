Subject: Regulatory Policy Committee

Guys, we have a unique capability at this time (ie) me in EES and Greg in EWS 
to have a singular voice in the regulatory market.  I would recommend a 
policy committee be formed including Greg, Dave, Janet Dietrich, John 
Lavorato, Tim Belden, Kevin Presto, Rick Shapiro and Steve Kean that meets on 
a regular basis to review and approve our regulatory agenda, policy and 
tactical moves on a regular basis.

Thoughts.....?

Regards
Delainey
