In a recent discussion with Mark H, he suggested that I consult you two 
gentlemen about outside counsel in Chicago to support our efforts with 
Peoples.  It would be beneficial to have a firm on board with some trading 
expertise, as well as more generalized transactional experience.  Gas would 
be a plus.

I've used Jones, Day  (good job on regulatory issues), and Piper Rudnick (bad 
experience).  Any suggestions?

Thanks,

Kay
