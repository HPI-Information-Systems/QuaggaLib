The fellow from Alliant keeps calling me to check on the status of his access 
to EnronOnline.  We received the executed ETA Amendment about 3 weeks ago and 
he is really hot to trade.  Can you give me some estimate of when we can 
expect to get him out of Credit, or call him if there are some credit 
issues?  His name is Steve Castleberg and his ph: is 608/877-8207.  Thanks!
