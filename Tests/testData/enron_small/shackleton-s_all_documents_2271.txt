Jason:  fyi.  Also, Randy Curry did call me yesterday but wasn't available 
when I returned the call.
Also, let's get Sakura Dellsher executed (and we should create a file since 
we're noting the ADM agreement which we did for Bridgeline).  Could we please 
talk this afternoon about outstanding agreements?  ss

hello Sara,

I think this should be a high priority once they take on an ISDA attorney.  
Per your recommendation, I contacted Randy Curry, President of Bridgeline and 
passed along your thoughts about Jason.  I gave him your phone number and he 
sounded enthusiastic about wanting to talk with him.  God knows they need an 
attorney.

Right now, I think we can take this off the priority list.

Thanks
Brant

Brant:  Is this really high priority (for our legal/credit discussions)?  We 
haven't heard from these guys since April 13.  Sara
