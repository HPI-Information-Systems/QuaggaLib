Pursuant to your request, attached is a very plain-vanilla motion to 
intervene out of time and motion to expedite that you can provide to your 
non-Gallup customers if you like.  If you do so, please inform them that we 
are not providing this as legal advice but merely as an example, and whether 
they choose to file in this proceeding and the content of what they file is 
up to their own respective legal and regulatory departments.
