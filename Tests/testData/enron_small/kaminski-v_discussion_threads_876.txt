Dr. Bill McMullen called you this morning and said that you had called
the school last week asking for courses that they scheduled for quantitive
analysis.

They gave your name to Dr. McMullen and he would like you to email
him exactly what you are looking for.

His email address is:  mcmullew@tamug.tamu.edu

Thanks!

Shirley
