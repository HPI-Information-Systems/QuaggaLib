day because the remote alarm/SCADA system was not fully operational when the 
station was

- cost associated with the original charge of glycol at each recip station

- turbine meter repairs associated wiith start up issues (ie: weld slag in 
fuel gas piping)

- the cost associated with air dispersion modeling for the DEQ permits

- some HMS costs for their time to install telemetry instruments and debug 
the SCADA system 

Please call if you need more detail.
