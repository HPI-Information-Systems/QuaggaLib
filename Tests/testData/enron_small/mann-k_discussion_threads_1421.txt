Mitch
Attached are SWPC revisions to your proposed letter. Our contracts group
advised to add signatures for all affected parties to the agreement, in
addition to know parties for contracts on Gleason and Wheatland sites, we
have added parties identified in draft Blue Girl contract, Enron input as to
appropriate Enron signatures for the Blue Girl would be appreciated.  Please
call with any concerns.
