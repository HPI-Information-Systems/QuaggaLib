Let's just keep it at 10 so we don't have to re-coordinate things.

I'm back.  I just changed my hair appt. to next week.  Would you rather meet
at 9 or 9:30 in the a.m.?  Let me know soon so I can change everyone around.
Should we leave it?  Phyllis is o.k. with either time.

Please call Carol.  How about the Buffalo Grille, or is that too busy?

Good!!  If you want to get Hollie, Lucinda, etc., to come, please feel free
to do so.  Is there any special place you want to go???

I have been thinking about you as well.  I have your bicycle and will
return
it to you when you are ready for it.  I can bring it on Saturday.  Will it
fit in your car?  If not, I can drop it by after breakfast.  Might need to
come by anyway to see what else you have done to it.

I will call Carol, too, if you don't care.

Breakfast at 10:00 sounds great!  Wherever you want to go...also, I need to
get my bike back from you, I might be doing some biking.  I've been
thinking about you.  Hope all is going well.

Miss Tana,

Is there a chance you might like to try to get together this weekend?  I
thought I would check with you first and then see if Phyllis is available.

I have a hair appointment at 8 a.m. on Saturday.  We could do breakfast at
10, or whatever...

Let me know.

Patti
