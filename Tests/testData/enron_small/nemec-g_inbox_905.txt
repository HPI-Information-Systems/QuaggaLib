Everything is going great over here.  We're really busy.  Come on over some
time and we'll give you the grand tour.  The varsity is on the 11th floor
of the Metro Building (Louisiana Place).

I caught the tail end of Wild At Heart last Sunday on the IFC channel ...
always awsome.  I got a satellite dish for my Father's Day present and
picked up some new channels including the Independent Film Channel and the
Sundance Channel

Well, back to work.

Mr.  Cook,  How is life at AEP?  The big E is still the same.  Minus
about 4 attorneys who decided to join you.
