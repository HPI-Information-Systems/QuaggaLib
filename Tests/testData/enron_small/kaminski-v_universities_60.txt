Kim,

Yes, the offer is coming. It may take a few days to process it, but you can 
count on it.

Vince:

I did get your phone message about the summer, but I still haven't heard from 
Enron about an offer for summer employment.  I do have other offers with 
other energy companies that I must respond to this week.  Could you let me 
know as soon as possible if an offer will be made to me.

Sincerely,
Kimberly Whitsel
Wharton MBA Candidate 2002
