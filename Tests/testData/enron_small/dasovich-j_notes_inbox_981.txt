Hi, Jeff --

I hope you had a great weekend.  I'm wondering if you've heard anything
about the coalition's decision making process for a PR agency.  I did call
Rick Counihan on Friday but his voicemail said he was out of town on
Thursday and Friday.  Chances are I'll hear from him this morning -- I'll
let you know if I do.  In the meantime, if you have any scoop, I'm all ears!

Thanks,

Dana
