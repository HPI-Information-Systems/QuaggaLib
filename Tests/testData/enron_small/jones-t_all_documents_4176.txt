Subject: TD volumes

Jon: I'm attaching TD's volumes (in GJs) for swap 1 with Enron Canada.  The 
fixed price is $5.983.  Just to be clear, these are how the volumes add up:
12/29/2000 422,002 GJ
03/29/2001 422,002 GJ
06/29/2001 422,002 GJ
90/27/2001 25,058,472 GJ

Jeff: can you size up the fixed price for the swap between ENA and Chase to 
reflect your spread on the above volumes?

John:  you can use the same volumes, but at the price you get from Jeff 
(which you will pass on to Enron Canada in our internal swap).

I will e-mail you RBC's volumes as soon as I confirm that they have locked in 
an interest rate (their volumes will be slightly different from TD's).  
Please call me with any questions.  Thanks,
-Catherine

PS:  TD has links to other databases embedded in this spreadsheet.  Before 
opening in Excel, go to a blank sheet and set to manual calculation (go to 
Tools, then Options)
