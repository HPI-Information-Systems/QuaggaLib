Could there be other counterparties that have the same concern as Hess?  You 
will have to explain to me what the issue was.  Thanks.  --Sally

Talked to Steve a few minutes ago.  We will adjust our process as necessary 
to allow Hess to aggregate trades on a daily basis.  I do not know the reason 
we stopped doing this but we will revert back to the old process.  Let me 
know if you need anything else.

I received  a phone call from Steve Semlitz who runs Hess Trading in New 
York.  He is frustrated with the new way he is dealing with settlement post 
the introduction of EOL.  In that now we do not allow him to aggregate.  
Please give him a call and find a way to resolve his problem.

Thanks

Let us know what happens.
