What topics do you think would be appropriate?  I will have just a few 
minutes.  I was thinking CFTC, electronic trading, physical trading forms and 
continued opening of power markets in North America to trading.

Mark,

We are putting together the brochure for the Members Update in London and
New York.  We would like to list the topics to be covered during each
presentation in bullet points on the agenda.   What topics would you suggest
we list for Energy.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Regards,

Rosemary
