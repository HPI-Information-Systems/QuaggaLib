Fran - It looks like you either made changes or added legs to this deal 
today. Do they need to reconfirm this? Please let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

Can you find out if we are supposed to confirm the legs of this City of 
Roseville deal that were input today.  And what it is exactly that they are 
doing with these legs.

Thanks!
