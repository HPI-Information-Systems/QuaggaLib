I have received the email below and have only two minor comments concerning
the Confirmation.

1.  In the "Cash Settlement Amount" paragraph, "Notional Amount" should be
changed to "Notional Quantity" to be consistent.

2.  For sake of avoiding doubt that the payment date is the fifth business
day following the date on which the product is priced for the last pricing
day of the prior month, I would amend the existing language of the Payment
Date(s) to add the following at the end of the sentence:  "for the
applicable Determination Period."

	If you have any questions or comments, please let me know.
