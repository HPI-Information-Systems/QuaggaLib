Joe - per our discussion on Friday, any assistance you can give Mark and I in selling February TW (West Tx Pool) gas would be appreciated. We can sell more term if need be.  I will forward you, under separate email, the details.  Mark will provide the exact volume prior to the end of day.  I've already talked to Allegany Supply Development and Cook Inlet.  Neither has shown much interest.  Mark sold January's balance to Sid Richardson.  Below is a list of other potential parties that may have interest in the gas (including the contact for Sid Richardson).

Thanks

cmm
