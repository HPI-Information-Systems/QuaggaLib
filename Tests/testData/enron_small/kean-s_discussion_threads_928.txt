Commencing with an NHK (Japanese public TV) report and quickly spreading to 
media inquiries and wire reports, earlier today a story spread through Japan 
that the Enron affiliate E Power has immediate plans to build at least one 
large (1000 MW) power plant.   In fact,  appears that E Power has been 
pursuing this prospect on a smaller scly, but nothing has progressed to high 
level management or board approval.




We are in the process of providing interviews and responding to inquiries 
from major Japanese media and others.  These inquiries have been in 
anticipation of the March 21 partial liberalization of the Japanese power 
sector.  These discussions also are being utilized to confirm that Enron will 
be opening a merchant office in Japan.  This is in addition to the EnCom/E 
Power affiliate, which is focused on industrial power generation.  Attached 
are the Q&As we are using in response to media inquiries.
