Attached is Indices of all projects as of 10/12/00. As you know, we will NOT 
update in DealBench until next update date (maybe next Tuesday?). These 
indices are currently matched with DealBench. Therefore, please wait until 
next update date and let me know then what is your changes/update.

I will also create a new diskette. Thanks.
