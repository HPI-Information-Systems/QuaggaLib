Hey Andy-
 
Long time since we last spoke.  I hope all is  well with you.  I assume you are still happily living in Texas.  I'm  still living in Colorado, and I met a nice girl named Paula, and we're getting  married.  Paula and I wanted to send you an invitation to our wedding in  August.  Can you send us your address so we can mail you an  invitation?
 
-Sully (and Paula)
