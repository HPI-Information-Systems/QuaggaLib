When did Bay State bill ENA for this?  And, did Bay State pay there bill for 
gas ENA sold them or did they deduct this from the payment?

It does work out to 5,500 dt per day at $.09.

Hello Chris,
Remember the demand charge that was entered in the sales side that you killed 
about a week ago?(deal # 233091)  Well, the demand charges need to be in the 
purchase side not the sales side.  Per Bay State, Enron should be paying the 
demand charges.  Are they correct???  Bay State is also charging interest for 
late payment.  Please let me know if you need any more information.
Production month Amount
April   $14,850.00
May   $15,345.00
June   $14,850.00
July   $15,345.00
August   $15,345.00
Interest   $926.32

Shawna,
I am Isabel and I work in Gas Settlements.  Could you help me out with the 
following?

Deal # 233091 for Bay State is charging a demand charge every month.  
Accourding to Bay State Enron should not be charging demand charges.  Could 
you let me know if this correct.  Should Enron be charging demand charges?  
Maureen Smith is down as the trader on the deal.  However, I am not sure if 
that is correct.  Please let me know if you are not the correct person to 
send this note too.  
Thank you for your help!
