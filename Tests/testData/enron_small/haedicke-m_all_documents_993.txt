Mark -

I was reviewing information Leslie had left behind and was curious if you 
ever had a chance to review and approve the Third Party Platform Policy that 
Leslie had prepared?  If not, I have attached a version of the policy below 
for your review.

The only change I see that needs to be made is the replacement of Leslie's 
name with mine.

Please let me know if you should need anything further.
