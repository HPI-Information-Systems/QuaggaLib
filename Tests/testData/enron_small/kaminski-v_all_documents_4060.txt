Vince,

Greetings.

I write at this time to follow up on your kind intercession on our behalf
with Jeff Skilling's office regarding his participation in our Spring
Conference.  We have secured hotel rooms at the Radisson Hotel, will
shortly have to provide a guarantee on those rooms, and would therefore
like to ascertain his participation as keynote speaker the evening of Thur.
2/22.

Hope all is well.  See you Oct. 11th, if not sooner.  Best,
Ehud
