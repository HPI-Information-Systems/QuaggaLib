Hi,

	My current boss - Dr. Vince Kaminski - has informed Enron Credit that I will be moving to your group.  In addition, he has me training my "successors" to take over my current projects.  

	I have accepted a verbal offer from Harry but wanted to know what the next steps are.  Should I be receiving something in writing regarding my new job description, title, moving arrangements to the 31st floor, etc.?

	Thanks in advance for your time.  

Regards,
Iris
