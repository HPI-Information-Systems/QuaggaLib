Hi, Sal.  Just saying hello.  Hope your interviews at OU went well.   You
are quite the interviewing queen!  Maybe you should write a book (or
article) sometime on "Keys to Snagging the Right Employee!".

Good news about Dad, huh?   So glad you were able to get him to see your
doctor to start the ball rolling on finding new answers for him.   It is a
lot of work to find the right answers for our healthcare!

We are starting to think more about the baby's room . . .  I think we're
leaning towards using your bed, if that's still okay.   Did you say that the
changing table would be available, too?  Is it light wood also?
I think we will probably get our own bed linens - but what do your look
like?   Boyish?   Do you think it's better to use a rocker or a glider?

Sorry we didn't make it for a fall trip.   It seems that almost every
weekend one of us has been gone - Chris leaves for Asia on Thursday for 2
weeks - it's a nonstop whirlwind of travel!

Thanksgiving should be fun . . . what shall we bring?     Is there any sort
of a plan for Friday?

I had my monthly doctor's appointment today:  the baby is still in there and
her mom is getting very fat!

I have really enjoyed my Halloween nutcracker this season!      Love, Cara
