I think he needs meds, including Prozac or something like that.  He is flat 
out having an anxiety attack.

There's a front coming in, and I'm surprised my sinuses aren't bad.  You know 
since I got off the allergy shots, I've been feeling a whole lot better.  
I'll be interested to see what the CT scan looked like too.  

Dan called and said he had lost 4 pounds in 2 hours and was wigging out.  He 
was going to wait another 2 hours and then call the doctor.  He's driving 
himself crazy.  They need to give him some meds to calm him down.  I hope 
it's nothing serious.

I don't blame you for wanting to go home.  I know where to find you if I need 
you.  I'll put calls into voicemail, but I'm not going to tell anyone you are 
at home (unless you want me to).

At the risk of sounding like a wimp, I may just go home after my hair 
apptment.  I don't feel up to snuff, and I think it is my sinuses (check the 
weather).  I can work from there just as well as I can from here, only in my 
jammys.
