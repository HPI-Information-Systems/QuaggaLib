The\ngoal is to create a version of Linux that is impervious to outside\nattacks.\n\nSecurity Enhanced Linux, or SELinux, is a project under development\nby the NSA to create a version of the operating system that is more\nsecure than the commercial distributions of Linux available from\nsoftware vendors and the open-source community. The PGP Security\ndivision of Network Associates is working with the NSA to modify the\nLinux source code so that applications running on a Linux server or\nPC have reduced access to a Linux machine's underlying operating\nsystem. The aim is to give Linux servers the ability to shirk off\n\"buffer overrun\" and \"format string\" attacks, which take advantage of\nloose ends in Linux applications to access a server's core operating\nsystem and shut it down. A Linux worm dubbed \"Lion\" was recently\nidentified as using this method to hack Linux servers.\n\nNSA has worked with other software firms to shore up other weaknesses\nin the operating system. Secure Computing has worked on the SELinux\nproject to add its Type Enforcement technology to SELinux. Type\nEnforcement protects the operating system and applications by\nsegmenting them into security \"domains\" with specifications on what\ntypes of files can be accessed by each domain. (For example, this\ncould be used to prevent access to a configuration file through an\napplication, such as Apache Web server). NSA is also working with\nVMWare to come up with a more secure user permissions system for\nallowing users with different security access to work on the same\nserver.\n\nThe good news for Linux users who are not high-level NSA operatives\nis that SELinux will be released to the open-source community once\nfinished. This means that commercial Linux vendors could include\nSELinux security enhancements in future releases, resulting in more\nbulletproof Linux Web and database servers in enterprises.\n\n_______________________________________________________________\nTo contact Phil Hochmuth:\n\nPhil Hochmuth is a staff writer for Network World, and\na former systems integrator.
