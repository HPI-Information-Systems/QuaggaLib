This\nsystem-wide warning is issued as a result of actual receipts into the\nsystem significantly exceeding actual deliveries. This Critical System\nWarning shall remain in place until further notice.\n\nWeather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and\nshippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation\nof the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Eastern's\nstorage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is\nvirtually no storage capacity or linepack available for system\noperational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual\nimbalances left on the system.\n\nBecause of the critical nature of this situation and the fact that Texas\nEastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being\nleft on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate\nwith their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system to\nmatch actual customer takes in the market area.  No due pipe gas will be\naccepted into the system until further notice.\n\nIf immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of\ngas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an\noperational flow order (\"OFO\") requiring actual receipts of gas to match\nactual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO\nnon-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm.  In addition and as\nprovided for in Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take\nany other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its\nsystem, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*******************************************************************\n\nNOTE:\n\nDuke Energy Gas Transmission respects your online time and privacy.\nYou have received this email because you elected to subscribe.
