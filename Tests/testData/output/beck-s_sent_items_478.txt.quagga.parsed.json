Lori also said that she had given Janet Petrak a hard copy of a permission slip to be printed in the December newsletter.  (This is for parents to sign for under 17's to be out after midnight as they return from Senior Presentation).  Do you have that?  If not, you might contact Janet and ask her for that.  --Sally   ", ""]}, {"from": "  -----Original Message-----  \t\"Beverly Gibson\" <bgibson50606@houston.rr.com>@ENRON  ", "to": " \tJanet Petrak; Beck, Sally", "cc": null, "sent": " \tTuesday, November  6, 2001 10:55 PM", "subject": " \tNCL newsletter information", "type": "reply", "raw_header": [" -----Original Message-----", "From: \t\"Beverly Gibson\" <bgibson50606@houston.rr.com>@ENRON  ", "Sent:\tTuesday, November  6, 2001 10:55 PM", "To:\tJanet Petrak; Beck, Sally", "Subject:\tNCL newsletter information"], "text": ["", "", "For next newsletter if space is  available:", " ", "When you need to send an  e-mail sub request, please follow this procedure:", "E-mail me at bgibson50606@houston.rr.com  with  the pertinent information (date, time, place).
