It will help to clarify a few issues.\n \n1. I was contacted by Christian (this means I did not start this phase of the process)\n    last Friday, as far as I can remember.\n \n    Christian expressed interest in joining the Research Group. I told him two things:\n       a. We would be delighted to have him here.\n       b. Our mutual relationship and good practices require that he receives\n           your blessing before we can move ahead.\n    We agreed to have a conference call Wed morning, your time, with you, Christian and\n    Mike Roberts.\n \n  2. Wednesday call was subsequently cancelled by Christian. Mike and I decided to call you\n      anyway Thu morning your time, directly, to discuss the matter. I was in a PRC all afternoon and \n      asked Mike to call you  in case I could not sneak out to join him. Mike called and was\n      told you were out sick.\n \n 3. I am leaving in a few hours for California. I shall be driving back to Houston for the next\n     3 days. Please, feel free to call Mike an discuss this matter with  him in my absence.\n \n 4. I think Christian has a strong preference to be in the Research Group, assuming he moves to\n     Houston. I think he came to this conclusion after visiting Houston in early July. I did not \n     bring up the issue of transfer with him at all when he was here.\n \n     I can  understand his motivation and think we should take his preferences into account. But the\n     first  issue is if he can leave Sydney at all.\n \nI hope it helps.
