I know you wanted an exact volume for 1/1 but I will not\nhave that for all of the Algonquin markets until Monday, 12/27.      We will\nneed a range from 3200 dth to 4200 dth per day.   This large swing is normal\nfor these types of markets due to weekends, weather, and customer situations.\n\n\n\n\n - agt012000.xls", "clean_body": "---------------------- Forwarded by Paul Drexelius/CES/ColumbiaGas on 12/27/99\n08:07 AM ---------------------------\n\n\nMarianne Stiles\n12/22/99 04:00 PM\n\nTo: Phil Villagomez/CES/ColumbiaGas@ColumbiaGas\ncc: Paul Drexelius/CES/ColumbiaGas@ColumbiaGas, Noel\nBartlo/CES/ColumbiaGas@ColumbiaGas, Joanne \nSwogger/CES/ColumbiaGas@ColumbiaGas,\nFrank Kronz/CES/ColumbiaGas@ColumbiaGas, Brian\nPerrone/CES/ColumbiaGas@ColumbiaGas, Melissa\nFlewellyn/CES/ColumbiaGas@ColumbiaGas, Morgan\nSharifi/CES/ColumbiaGas@ColumbiaGas\nSubject: January 2000 AGT volumes\n\nHere are the approximate January daily volumes for each of the gates.
