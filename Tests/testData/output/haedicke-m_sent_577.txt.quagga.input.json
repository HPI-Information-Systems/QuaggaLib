An eyewitness testified that she was only an=\n=20\narm's length away from defendant when she saw him \"key\" the complainant's=\n=20\nvehicle, then enter a business.

Moss\ne-Journal Number: 8387\nJudge(s): Per Curiam - Neff, Talbot, and Sullivan\n\nThe prosecution introduced sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact=\n=20\nto conclude that defendant acted willfully and maliciously, regardless of=\n=20\nwhether he was intoxicated to some degree, when he set fire to the victims'=\n=20\nhome. Even if defendant was drunk when arrested approximately 22 hours afte=\nr=20\nthe fire, his intoxication did not bear any relation to his state of mind o=\nn=20\nthe night of the fire. The testimony indicated that even if defendant was=\n=20\nintoxicated, he remained fully capable of entertaining the necessary specif=\nic=20\nintent. The evidence established that (1) defendant appeared at the victims=\n'=20\nhome three times and was there purposely prior to the fire, (2) defendant h=\nad=20\nno reported difficulty safely traveling to and from the victims' house, (3)=\n=20\ndefendant threatened the victims that he would return to harm them, and (4)=\n=20\ndefendant followed through with the threats later that night when he=20\npurchased kerosene, transported it to the victims' home, poured it onto the=\n=20\nporch and into the mail slot, and set fire to the home.

Although defendant threw torn pieces of paper from the passenger=\n=20\ndoor of the vehicle during the pursuit by the police, the credit card numbe=\nrs=20\nrecovered from the torn pieces of paper were not similar to the credit card=\n=20\nnumbers given by defendant's brother to purchase merchandise.

Rose\ne-Journal Number: 8385\nJudge(s): Per Curiam - McDonald, Sawyer, and White\n\nThe trial court erred in suppressing defendant's statements to police on th=\ne=20\nbasis that defendant was in custody and thus entitled to Miranda warnings=\n=20\nfrom the outset of the interview. Defendant agreed to speak with the police=\n,=20\ndrove himself to the station, and was informed prior to the interview that =\nhe=20\nwas not under arrest and was free to leave. At no time was he told that he=\n=20\nwas not free to leave, and the door was left open. The officer's failure to=\n=20\ntell defendant that he was being investigated for CSC did not alter the fac=\nt=20\nthat defendant was told he was free to leave, or render the interview a=20\ncustodial one. Further, under the totality of the circumstances, defendant'=\ns=20\nstatements were knowingly and voluntarily made, and were not the product of=\n=20\npsychological coercion. Defendant was 21-years old, had completed three yea=\nrs=20\nof college, and discerned the focus of the officer's inquiries soon after t=\nhe=20\ninterview began.

Belgiorno\ne-Journal Number: 8389\nJudge(s): Per Curiam - Wilder, Smolenski, and Whitbeck\n\nThe trial court erred because it did not conduct an evidentiary hearing=20\nbefore it entered an order modifying the parties' custody. The trial court'=\ns=20\norder placing physical custody of the parties' minor child with=20\nplaintiff-mother was vacated and remanded to (1) conduct an evidentiary=20\nhearing, (2) state specific findings of fact and conclusions of law on the=\n=20\nrecord, (3) determine whether an established custodial environment existed,=\n=20\n(4) determine whether proper cause or a change of circumstances existed tha=\nt=20\njustified a change of custody, and (5) address the best interest factors to=\n=20\ndetermine the best interest of the child.\n\nFull Text Opinion\n\nBack to Quicklinks\n\nIssues: Termination of parental rights pursuant to oo 19b(3)(a)(ii), (c)(i)=\n,=20\n(g), and (j); Proper service of summons for adjudicative hearing; Failure t=\no=20\nchallenge one of the statutory grounds for termination\nCourt: Michigan Court of Appeals (Unpublished)\nCase Name: In re Glover\ne-Journal Number: 8379\nJudge(s): Per Curiam - Neff, Talbot, and Sullivan\n\nThe family court did not err in finding that statutory grounds for=20\ntermination of respondent-mother's parental rights were established by clea=\nr=20\nand convincing evidence.

I=\nt=20\nwas improper for the trial court to inquire into respondent's ability to pa=\ny=20\nchild support under o 51(6)(a) where there was an existing support order. T=\nhe=20\norder that reserved the question of support because respondent was=20\nincarcerated constituted a judicial determination that respondent lacked th=\ne=20\nability to pay.

The City of Detroit\ne-Journal Number: 8399\nJudge(s): Nelson, Moore, and Wilhoit\n\nThe district court correctly dismissed plaintiff's suit against both the ci=\nty=20\nand state defendants because plaintiff, an unsuccessful bidder for a licens=\ne=20\nto operate a Detroit casino, lacked standing. The court in Lac Vieux=20\npreviously held that the state law preference exempting certain preferred=\n=20\ndevelopers from the competitive bidding process and allowing a tie-breaking=\n=20\npreference for applicants that had supported the initiative legalizing casi=\nno=20\ngambling in Detroit had been eliminated. Since the preference was=20\nineffective, there could be no injury and no case or controversy against th=\ne=20\nstate defendants in regard to the state statute. As to the city defendants,=\n=20\nthe mayor unequivocally testified that no preference was applied at any sta=\nge=20\nof the competitive selection process until after plaintiff had already been=\n=20\neliminated from the competition.

In this case a\nperson of ordinary intelligence would understand that hitting a 13-year old\ngirl more than once in the face severe enough to necessitate a hospital\nvisit, pulling her hair, or pushing her into a wall causing her to become\ndizzy would fall within the purview of cruelty. The family court order taking\njurisdiction over the minor child was affirmed.\n\nFull Text Opinion\n\nCriminal Law\n\nBack to Quicklinks\n\nIssues: Denial of defense motion for a lineup; Prosecutorial misconduct\nCourt: Michigan Court of Appeals (Unpublished)\nCase Name: People v. Cain\ne-Journal Number: 8381\nJudge(s): Per Curiam - Neff, Talbot, and Sullivan\n\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendant's\nuntimely motion for a lineup. An eyewitness testified that she was only an\narm's length away from defendant when she saw him \"key\" the complainant's\nvehicle, then enter a business. The manager of the business, notified of the\nkeying incident shortly after it occurred, testified that defendant was the\nonly person in the building lobby matching the perpetrator's description.\nAlthough eyewitness identification was a material issue, a lineup would not\nhave resolved any \"mistaken identification\" in this case. The trial court\nalso properly considered the untimeliness of the motion, and the possible\nhardship a delay for a lineup could have had on the eyewitness, who resided\nin another state. Defendant's conviction of malicious destruction of property\nover $100 was affirmed.\n\nFull Text Opinion\n\nBack to Quicklinks\n\nIssues: Whether the trial court erred in finding that defendant was the\ncarjacker; Identification; Witness credibility; Whether the lineup was unduly\nsuggestive; Sufficiency of evidence to convict of carjacking\nCourt: Michigan Court of Appeals (Unpublished)\nCase Name: People v. Fordham\ne-Journal Number: 8380\nJudge(s): Per Curiam - Neff, Talbot, and Sullivan\n\nSince both the victim and a police officer identified the defendant as the\nman who stole the victim's car and the trial court concluded that the victim\nwas not confused when he identified the defendant as the carjacker, the trial\ncourt's finding that defendant was one of the carjackers was not clearly\nerroneous. There was sufficient evidence based on the identification evidence\nfor a rational trier of fact to have concluded that defendant committed the\ncarjacking. Affirmed.\n\nFull Text Opinion\n\n\nBack to Quicklinks\n\nIssues: Sufficient evidence of intent to convict for arson of a dwelling\nhouse; Whether defendant was too intoxicated to have formed the requisite\nintent\nCourt: Michigan Court of Appeals (Unpublished)\nCase Name: People v. Moss\ne-Journal Number: 8387\nJudge(s): Per Curiam - Neff, Talbot, and Sullivan\n\nThe prosecution introduced sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact\nto conclude that defendant acted willfully and maliciously, regardless of\nwhether he was intoxicated to some degree, when he set fire to the victims'\nhome. Even if defendant was drunk when arrested approximately 22 hours after\nthe fire, his intoxication did not bear any relation to his state of mind on\nthe night of the fire. The testimony indicated that even if defendant was\nintoxicated, he remained fully capable of entertaining the necessary specific\nintent. The evidence established that (1) defendant appeared at the victims'\nhome three times and was there purposely prior to the fire, (2) defendant had\nno reported difficulty safely traveling to and from the victims' house, (3)\ndefendant threatened the victims that he would return to harm them, and (4)\ndefendant followed through with the threats later that night when he\npurchased kerosene, transported it to the victims' home, poured it onto the\nporch and into the mail slot, and set fire to the home. Affirmed.\n\nFull Text Opinion\n\nBack to Quicklinks\n\nIssues: Whether there was sufficient evidence to support convictions for\naiding and abetting false pretenses, attempted false pretenses, and stealing\nor retaining a financial transaction device\nCourt: Michigan Court of Appeals (Unpublished)\nCase Name: People v. Pitts\ne-Journal Number: 8395\nJudge(s): Per Curiam - Neff, Talbot, and Sullivan\n\nThere was insufficient evidence that defendant performed acts or gave\nencouragement that assisted the commission of the crimes to support his\nconvictions for aiding and abetting false pretenses and attempted false\npretenses. Although defendant threw torn pieces of paper from the passenger\ndoor of the vehicle during the pursuit by the police, the credit card numbers\nrecovered from the torn pieces of paper were not similar to the credit card\nnumbers given by defendant's brother to purchase merchandise. There was no\nevidence associating defendant with the representations that were made to the\nemployees by his brother regarding the validity of the credit card numbers.\nDefendant's convictions for aiding and abetting false pretenses and attempted\nfalse pretenses were reversed.\n\nFull Text Opinion\n\nBack to Quicklinks\n\nIssues: Suppression of defendant's inculpatory statements; Whether\ninterrogation was custodial; Whether defendant's statements were knowingly\nand voluntarily made; Totality of the circumstances\nCourt: Michigan Court of Appeals (Unpublished)\nCase Name: People v. Rose\ne-Journal Number: 8385\nJudge(s): Per Curiam - McDonald, Sawyer, and White\n\nThe trial court erred in suppressing defendant's statements to police on the\nbasis that defendant was in custody and thus entitled to Miranda warnings\nfrom the outset of the interview. Defendant agreed to speak with the police,\ndrove himself to the station, and was informed prior to the interview that he\nwas not under arrest and was free to leave. At no time was he told that he\nwas not free to leave, and the door was left open. The officer's failure to\ntell defendant that he was being investigated for CSC did not alter the fact\nthat defendant was told he was free to leave, or render the interview a\ncustodial one. Further, under the totality of the circumstances, defendant's\nstatements were knowingly and voluntarily made, and were not the product of\npsychological coercion. Defendant was 21-years old, had completed three years\nof college, and discerned the focus of the officer's inquiries soon after the\ninterview began. The trial court's order suppressing defendant's statements\nwas reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings.\n\nFull Text Opinion\n\nBack to Quicklinks\n\nIssues: Prosecutorial misconduct; Other acts evidence; Admission of witness'\ntestimony; Jury instructions\nCourt: Michigan Court of Appeals (Unpublished)\nCase Name: People v. Vaughn\ne-Journal Number: 8383\nJudge(s): Per Curiam - O'Connell, Kelly, and Whitbeck\n\nAlthough the defendant argued that the prosecutor improperly referred to an\naccomplice's plea agreement to bolster that witness' testimony, defendant did\nnot show that he was prejudiced. The prosecutor did not engage in misconduct\nby eliciting testimony and arguing that the plea agreement required the\nwitness to testify truthfully, because the prosecutor did not personally\nvouch for the witness' credibility. Affirmed.\n\nFull Text Opinion\n\nFamily Law\n\nBack to Quicklinks\n\nIssues: Modification of a custody order without conducting an evidentiary\nhearing; Trial court's failure to identify the change of circumstances,\nwhether an established custodial environment existed, or an analysis of the\nbest interest factors; Reassignment of custody matter to a different judge\nCourt: Michigan Court of Appeals (Unpublished)\nCase Name: Belgiorno v. Belgiorno\ne-Journal Number: 8389\nJudge(s): Per Curiam - Wilder, Smolenski, and Whitbeck\n\nThe trial court erred because it did not conduct an evidentiary hearing\nbefore it entered an order modifying the parties' custody. The trial court's\norder placing physical custody of the parties' minor child with\nplaintiff-mother was vacated and remanded to (1) conduct an evidentiary\nhearing, (2) state specific findings of fact and conclusions of law on the\nrecord, (3) determine whether an established custodial environment existed,\n(4) determine whether proper cause or a change of circumstances existed that\njustified a change of custody, and (5) address the best interest factors to\ndetermine the best interest of the child.\n\nFull Text Opinion\n\nBack to Quicklinks\n\nIssues: Termination of parental rights pursuant to oo 19b(3)(a)(ii), (c)(i),\n(g), and (j); Proper service of summons for adjudicative hearing; Failure to\nchallenge one of the statutory grounds for termination\nCourt: Michigan Court of Appeals (Unpublished)\nCase Name: In re Glover\ne-Journal Number: 8379\nJudge(s): Per Curiam - Neff, Talbot, and Sullivan\n\nThe family court did not err in finding that statutory grounds for\ntermination of respondent-mother's parental rights were established by clear\nand convincing evidence. Respondent did not begin to work on her treatment\nplan until approximately one month before the termination hearings. Further,\nwhile she was required to seek substance abuse treatment or submit to drug\ntesting, she failed to do either. Since respondent made no significant\nprogress in these areas, and considering her past history, respondent's\nparental rights were properly terminated under oo 19b(3)(c)(i), (g), and (j).\nAffirmed.\n\nFull Text Opinion\n\nBack to Quicklinks\n\nThis summary also appears under Constitutional Law\n\nIssues: Jurisdiction over the minor child; Whether the term \"cruelty\" in o\n2(b) is unconstitutionally vague; Jury instructions\nCourt: Michigan Court of Appeals (Unpublished)\nCase Name: In re Herronen\ne-Journal Number: 8384\nJudge(s): Per Curiam - Fitzgerald, Hood, and McDonald\n\nThe term \"cruelty\" as used in the statute is not unconstitutionally vague\nbecause it gives fair notice to a person of ordinary intelligence and a\nreasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited or required.

It\nwas improper for the trial court to inquire into respondent's ability to pay\nchild support under o 51(6)(a) where there was an existing support order. The\norder that reserved the question of support because respondent was\nincarcerated constituted a judicial determination that respondent lacked the\nability to pay. The trial court also erred by failing to appoint counsel for\nrespondent upon his request because in a stepparent adoption proceeding under\no 51(6)(a), the trial court has discretion to appoint counsel for an indigent\nnonconsenting parent.\n\nFull Text Opinion\n\nLitigation\n\nBack to Quicklinks\n\nIssues: Standing; Case or controversy; Absence of an injury-in-fact;\nChallenge to constitutionality of a legalized gambling scheme; Standard of\nreview; Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians v. Michigan\nGaming Control Bd.\nCourt: U.S. Court of Appeals Sixth Circuit\nCase Name: Barden Detroit Casino, L.L.C. v. The City of Detroit\ne-Journal Number: 8399\nJudge(s): Nelson, Moore, and Wilhoit\n\nThe district court correctly dismissed plaintiff's suit against both the city\nand state defendants because plaintiff, an unsuccessful bidder for a license\nto operate a Detroit casino, lacked standing. The court in Lac Vieux\npreviously held that the state law preference exempting certain preferred\ndevelopers from the competitive bidding process and allowing a tie-breaking\npreference for applicants that had supported the initiative legalizing casino\ngambling in Detroit had been eliminated. Since the preference was\nineffective, there could be no injury and no case or controversy against the\nstate defendants in regard to the state statute. As to the city defendants,\nthe mayor unequivocally testified that no preference was applied at any stage\nof the competitive selection process until after plaintiff had already been\neliminated from the competition. Therefore, the preference was never applied\nto plaintiff's detriment, and plaintiff suffered no actual injury. Affirmed.\n\nFull Text Opinion\n\nMalpractice\n\nBack to Quicklinks\n\nIssues: Medical malpractice; Statute of limitations; Discovery rule; Whether\ndefendant's failure to produce plaintiff's medical records excused timely\nfiling of a pre-suit notice\nCourt: Michigan Court of Appeals (Unpublished)\nCase Name: Cabell v. Carino\ne-Journal Number: 8382\nJudge(s): Per Curiam - McDonald, Sawyer, and White\n\nThe trial court properly granted defendant-orthopedist summary disposition on\nthe grounds that plaintiff's pre-suit notice was not filed within two years\nof the act or omission that was the basis of the claim. While plaintiff's\nclaim accrued in March 1995, he did not file a notice of intent to sue until\nJune 1997. Plaintiff's assertion that he did not discover his claim until he\nreceived his medical records from defendant in April 1997 was without merit.\nPlaintiff's deposition testimony established that by June 1995, at the\nlatest, he was aware of a problem with his toe following defendant's\ntreatment for an ankle fracture, and actually believed that the cast\ndefendant placed on his ankle and foot had caused the problem. Plaintiff's\nattorney was investigating his claim in October 1995. Plaintiff's claim that\ndefendant's failure to produce plaintiff's medical records in response to his\nrequest excused the timely filing of the notice of intent also failed.\nAffirmed.\n\nFull Text Opinion\n\nWorker's Compensation\n\nBack to Quicklinks\n\nIssues: Claim for weekly wage loss benefits based on mental disability; The\nGardner formulation of the statutory test for determining whether an employee\nhas suffered a compensable mental disability; The Worker's Compensation\nAppellate Commission (WCAC)\nCourt: Michigan Court of Appeals (Unpublished)\nCase Name: White v. Department of Agric.\ne-Journal Number: 8393\nJudge(s): Per Curiam - Owens, Jansen, and Burns\n\nThe magistrate properly determined that although an incident where\nplaintiff's supervisor kicked him to wake plaintiff up after he nodded off on\nthe job may have appeared objectively insignificant to the average person,\nthere was substantial evidence from plaintiff's physician establishing that\nbecause it would not take much of a stimulus to trigger a response in a\npatient with a preexisting borderline personality, the kicking incident\ncontributed to, aggravated, or accelerated plaintiff's mental condition in a\nsignificant manner. All that is statutorily required are actual events of\nemployment, even if objectively unimportant, that contribute to, aggravate,\nor accelerate a mental disability in a significant manner. The decision of\nthe WCAC reversing the magistrate and denying plaintiff's claim for weekly\nwage loss benefits on the basis of a mental disability was reversed, and\nremanded the case for reinstatement of the magistrate's award.\n\nFull Text Opinion\n\nfields of practice listingsADR/Arbitration/Mediation\n\nASHER N.
