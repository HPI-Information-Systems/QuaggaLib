In my absence he serves as my eyes and ears to the overall business.  While I have been in Houston we speak daily regarding all management of the business including, but not limited to contracting with over 40 counterparties, long term origination including Allegheny and Constellation, control of enovate credit policy, control of enovate risk management policy (with Frank Hayden) and overall office management.  Gregg receives high marks from Enron legal, credit, risk management, and finance as a tremendous resource and from Peoples Sr. Management.  I believe Enron many times overlooks the importance of account management and Gregg is a classic example of an employee who balances the needs of the customer with keeping Enron's interests foremost.  I am confident Gregg is key to ensuring the transaction with Peoples is renewed in 3 years.", "", "Richard holds responsibility for the daily business of enovate.  He is proven in his ability to hold the trust of Peoples Gas/North Shore providing an array of \"no-risk\" value for Enron and enovate.  Richard serves as the information conduit to the Central desk and Enron Houston.  Richard is excellent at balancing his role to Enron and the complete trust that Peoples has placed in him.  Richard is a rare find and perfect fit in a joint venture because of his tenure at Enron involving stints in economics, risk management, structuring and trading.  Richard is the key reason we have kept a balance of trust with the utilities of Peoples.  Richard has been engaged with this customer for 3 years and the trust/knowledge Peoples bestows to Richard is directly related to this history, Richard's hard work and inherent customer skills.    A departure by Richard would provide a very difficult issue for Hunter and I due to the balanced approach Richard exemplifies.  Richard is Hunter's on sight control of the enovate business.", "", "If you would like to discuss this further, please contact me at 713/853-3855.
