Recitals.  We do not see why it would be necessary to add\nthat\n   \"The Guarantor will directly or indirectly benefit from the\n   Transactions between the Beneficiary and PMI\".  Please explain.\n[Heard,\n   Marie]    Because (i) it is a correct statement and (ii) it clarifies\n   the element of consideration which is essential for purposes of\n   enforceability.\n\n   2.      Section 1.  Considering that Pemex normally needs 5 business\n   days to request funds in foreing currencies to the Central Bank, we\n   need to change the payment date to be 5 Business Days after receipt\nof\n   the Payment Demand instead of 3 days. [Heard, Marie]    We are okay\nwith\n   this change.\n\n   3.      Section 6. Jurisdiction.  We think that New York\nJurisdiction is\n   a good option and probably the most experienced in terms of\nderivatives\n   trading, and therefore we prefer to keep the \"exclusive\" jurisdiction\n   of any federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan. [Heard,\nMarie]\n      We are okay with the \"exclusive\" jurisdiction.\n\n   The rest of your comments are acceptable to us.  Carlos Riveroll will\n   be sending you PMI?s comments to the amendment to the MSA, so we can\n   finalize this as soon as posible.\n\n   Best regards,\n\n   Martha Navarro\n\n    - WINMAIL.DAT << File: WINMAIL.DAT >>\n\n\n\n**********************************************************************\nThis e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant\naffiliate and may contain confidential and privileged material for the\nsole use of the intended recipient (s).
