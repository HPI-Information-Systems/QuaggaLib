To the extent (and only\nto the extent) that a purchase is not otherwise paid by any party or payable\nby another party meeting the credit standards set forth in the ISO Tariff\n(another \"Qualified Party\"), DWR will assume financial responsibility for\nall purchases by the ISO in its ancillary services and imbalance energy\nmarkets based on bids or other offers determined to be reasonable. Such\ndetermination of reasonableness will be made by DWR on a case by case basis\nand communicated to the ISO.  All bids into the ancillary services and\nimbalance energy markets will be deemed to be contingent on the acceptance\nof financial responsibility by DWR, to the extent not paid or payable by\nanother Qualified Party.  Unless a supplier is otherwise notified, any bid\naccepted by the ISO will be deemed to have the financial support of another\nQualified Party or DWR as specified in this notice.  In addition to the\nforegoing, DWR will assume financial responsibility for all purchases\nresulting from the issuance by the ISO of emergency dispatch instructions,\nto the extent not paid or payable by another Qualified Party.  Payment for\nsuch purchases shall be made according to the rate specified in the ISO\nTariff for emergency dispatch instructions.  The ISO and/or DWR reserve the\nright to rescind or modify the foregoing arrangements at any time and for\nany reason, including a successful rehearing or appeal from the April 6\norder.\n\nAs the FERC determined in its February 14 order that DWR is a creditworthy\ncounterparty, the ISO believes that the foregoing arrangements meet the\nrequirements of FERC's April 6 Order. Accordingly, the ISO expects that\nsuppliers will honor their obligations under the ISO Tariff and related\nagreements to respond to ISO dispatch instructions.\n\nDon Fuller\nDirector, Client Relations\nCalifornia ISO\nPhone: 916-608-7055\nE-Mail: dfuller@caiso.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "clean_body": "By agreeing to pay only for \"reasonable\" offers, DWR left itself a loophole \nbig enough to drive a truck through:\n\n\"DWR will assume financial responsibility for\nall purchases by the ISO in its ancillary services and imbalance energy\nmarkets based bids or other offers determined to be reasonable.
