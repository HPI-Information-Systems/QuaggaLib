I note that the\nJune injection for the TCO storage appears to be only about half of what we\nrequested and what appears in our GMS system.  My ultimate objective here is \nto\nprovide The New Power Company with  definitive estimates of the end-of-July\ninventories (including left-over inventory from last winter) as well as the\nvolumes \"injected\" in July alone.
