No run hour limitation.\nTaxes: Fee in lieu of taxes at 1/3 cost for first ten years.  Full property \ntaxes thereafter.  Entergy claims this is the same deal Ben Jacoby got for \nour peaker in MS.\n\nFirst we need to model a pro-forma of plant operating costs using estimates \nof FOM and VOM from internal sources.\nSecond, we need to calculate spread option valuations of the underlying plant \nfor 20-years using curve, vol and correlation assumptions acceptable to the \ndesk.\nThirdly and based on 20-year plant valuations, I need to create a debt \nservice schedule.\nFinally, we have to price the put option premium and sensitivities using the \nresearch/structuring model.\n\nAny questions, please call me at 3-4750.\n\nregards,\n\nDon", "clean_body": "Team,\n\nI finally got a chance to talk to Entergy about their merchant peaker in \ntheir own service territory.
