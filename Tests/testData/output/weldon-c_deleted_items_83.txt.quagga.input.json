Usually this affront is\nled by a gaggle of secularists, liberals, and multiculturalists.\nHowever, this year there seems to be a festering opposition led by\ncertain Christians to the yuletide season. Even though these criticisms\nhave not yet risen to the level of disruptive street theater engaged in\nby their unbelieving counterparts, they nevertheless reveal a somewhat\ndubious ecclesio-social philosophy.\n\nThe basic Christian anti-Christmas argument runs something like this:\nsince the commemoration of Christmas is not explicitly commanded by\nScripture, its celebration is therefore forbidden.  Furthermore, since\ncertain aspects of the holiday might be traceable to pagan origins, the\ncommitted Christian is obligated to have no parts of them.\n\nRead more at http://gopusa.com/opinion/fm_010302.shtml\n\n========================================================================\n\nSUBSCRIBE TODAY!
