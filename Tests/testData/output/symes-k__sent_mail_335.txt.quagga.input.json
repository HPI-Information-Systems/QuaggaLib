I also have questions on the \nfollowing deals:\n\n557772 - why are we not confirming a daily with Pacificorp?\n552516 - why are we not confirming a daily with Riverside?\n\nAnd there were two deals I couldn't for the life of me read on that fax, so \nyou may still see deals showing up that don't necessarily need to be \nconfirmed.\n\n\nDiana - \nI know we had decided not to confirm deals done with Portland General \nElectric, but before I change the following deals to \"no confirm\" I want to \nclarify under what conditions we do not confirm with this counterparty.\n 1. If the counterparty is PGE and the delivery point is elsewhere (Mid-C, \nMontana System, etc.), do we confirm?\n 2. If the counterparty is something other than PGE and the delivery point is \nPortland General System, do we confirm?\n 3.
