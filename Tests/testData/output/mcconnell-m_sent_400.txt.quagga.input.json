I remain quite\ninterested in your comment that Enrononline expects to trade more coal that\nnatural gas or electricity in the future.\n\nAs we discussed, we are the dominant software fossil fuel developers in the\ngenerating space, having our operating systems installed in 23 of the\nlargest generating companies.  The largest of our customers are also the\nlargest consumers of coal, and include TVA, Southern, AEP, First Energy,\nCP&L, Exelon, New Century/Excel, and Southern Energy, among others.  At\nseveral of the companies' request, we have developed our Fuel Optimizer\nModule (FPO), which tells the fuel buyer what the delivered cost to a plant\nspecific specifications is, once the coal cost is factored into the\nequation.\n\nAttached is an overview of our system, and the specs on the FPO.  Please\nforward these on the appropriate people in your organization.  I look\nforward to hearing from them.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nDavid\n\n - David W.
