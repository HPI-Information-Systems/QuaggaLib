As a reminder, you are slated\nto sit on the executive option/equity dilution panel on Saturday\nmorning.  Dave Yermack from NYU, the number one expert on this issue, is\npresenting at that session.  (Again, serving as a panelist should require\nlittle preparation on your behalf.)\n\nAlso, you and your wife are welcome to attend the dinner on Friday evening,\nMay 4.  It will be held in the Baker Institute across from the business\nschool.  Tom Copeland is our speaker - (I think he plans to focus his\nremarks on real options).  Vince Kaminski  has told me he will be at the\ndinner, however his wife is out of town and will not be.\n\nPlease call me direct if I can be of any help or assistance.   I look\nforward to seeing you soon.
