Bellemare\nVice President=20\n\n\n  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/rbellrgb100border.jpg>\n\nConstellation Energy's (NYSE:CEG) shares fell nearly 11 percent on Friday i=\nn response to announcements that the company is cutting its earnings' proje=\nctions, shelving plans to split the company into two parts, and severing it=\ns ties with investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) which would have been a=\n minority partner in its energy-trading operation if the spin-off had gone =\nahead.=20\n\nAnalysis: Constellation Energy's stock value dropped to its lowest level in=\n seven years-down nearly 11 percent in one day, and down over 45 percent si=\nnce May 1, 2001. But perhaps what is most important about Constellation is =\nits shift in business strategy as it becomes the second company of the week=\n to announce it is withdrawing plans to split its company into two parts. E=\narlier in the week Allegheny Energy (NYSE:AYE) announced it would hold off =\non its planned initial public offering (IPO) of Allegheny Energy Supply Com=\npany, its unregulated power generation and trading subsidiary, until market=\n conditions improve.=20\n\nThe dramatic shift in company strategy appears to be driven by the same for=\nces. Constellation sited falling energy prices, the changing nature of the =\nCalifornia power crisis and weak economic conditions as the main reasons fo=\nr dropping its company-separation plans. The company said it would now focu=\ns on using its \"single\" status to leverage its balance sheet to participate=\n in the consolidation of the wholesale electricity industry in the United S=\ntates. \"What seems to matter now is size and stability and we think that co=\nmes from being a single company ? What has changed (in the last one year) i=\ns the significant change in the immediate growth rate we are seeing for new=\n power plants ? the reasons are simple and profound. The world has changed,=\n'' Constellation Energy Chairman Christian Poindexter said in a conference =\ncall with the media.=20\n\nThe change in Constellation's strategy will be costly. The company will pay=\n Goldman Sachs about $355 million to terminate their power-marketing agreem=\nent, $159 million which Goldman had previously put in the business, and $19=\n6 million in future income Goldman would have earned had the business conti=\nnued. Constellation expects the Goldman Sachs business termination will cau=\nse the company to record a $200-million special expense in the fourth quart=\ner. The company said that its split-up with Goldman Sachs was amicable. Gol=\ndman's relationship with Constellation started in the mid-nineties when the=\n investment bank was looking for a partner to help it break into the energy=\n trading and marketing business. In 1999 Goldman agreed it would take a 17.=\n5-percent stake in Constellation's trading business when the state of Maryl=\nand deregulated the power industry and Constellation decided to make a sepa=\nrate trading company. Poindexter indicated that Goldman did not want to be =\npart of a situation where energy trading and generation would remain togeth=\ner.\n\nIt certainly has been an active week for Constellation as it has made other=\n significant announcements concerning its future plans. Mayo A. Shattuck II=\nI was elected to the position of president and CEO effective Nov. 1, 2001. =\nShattuck recently resigned his position as chairman and CEO of Deutsche Ban=\nc. Alex Brown and has served on Constellation's board of directors for the =\npast seven years. On Oct. 24, the New York Public Service Commission said i=\nt would approve the sale of Niagara Mohawk's Nine Mile nuclear generating s=\ntation in New York to Constellation Nuclear for $780 million. Constellation=\n Nuclear is a unit of the Constellation Energy Group. As part of the sale, =\nConstellation has agreed to sell 90 percent of Nine Mile's output at fixed =\nprices for 10 years, or through August 2009 if the operating license of Nin=\ne Mile 1 is not extended.=20\n\nThe unregulated generation and trading activities continue to drive the bul=\nk of earnings for both Constellation and Allegheny. Constellation's domesti=\nc merchant energy business contributed $0.89 of their $1.00 earnings per sh=\nare of common stock for the quarter ending Sept. 30, 2001, slightly higher =\nthan last year when the business contributed $0.87 of the $0.98 per share i=\nn earnings for the same quarter. Allegheny Energy reported that their third=\n-quarter profits more than doubled on increased generation capacity and the=\n acquisition of a trading and marketing unit. Allegheny's third-quarter ear=\nnings were $1.33 per share, compared with $0.69 per share one year ago, and=\n beating analysts' earnings of $1.10 to $1.28 per share. Allegheny is confi=\ndent that its year-end earnings will be within its guidance range of $3.80 =\nto $4.10 per share.=20\n\nDespite the strong earnings, Allegheny's stock price has dropped over 30 pe=\nrcent since May, and over 5 percent in the past 10 trading days. The drop i=\nn energy stock value appears to be driven by softening wholesale power pric=\nes. Earlier in the month Lehman Brothers lowered its estimate of Allegheny'=\ns 2002 earnings by 12 cents, to $4.03, citing reduced forward power price a=\nssumptions.=20\n\nThe high-flying days of the recent past, where energy companies' price-to-e=\narnings (P/E) multiples were exceeding 50 in certain cases, appear to be ov=\ner. Many power producers are returning to their roots-scrapping plans for s=\nplitting operations and questioning whether more risky overseas operations =\ncan be supported by lower prices brought on by a slowing economy and soften=\ning wholesale market prices. Paul Patterson, an energy analyst with ABN Amr=\no, said there are common themes affecting the industry: \"One is lower power=\n prices and the margins that are associated with them. And two is lower sto=\nck prices and the ability to finance more asset driven growth.\"=20\n\nAES Corp. (NYSE:AES ), apparently agrees. Its earnings fell for a second co=\nnsecutive quarter on poor results from operations in Brazil and Britain and=\n said last Thursday it would revamp its organization and did not rule out s=\nelling off assets. AES' Chief Executive Officer Dennis Bakke indicated AES =\nwas placing a renewed emphasis on the traditionally profitable, long-term c=\nontract generation business. By placing generating capacity into long-term =\ncontracts a company is able to provide profit stability during times of fla=\nt growth. Just one year ago physical reserve margins in power markets were =\nvery low, allowing generation companies to achieve high profits for their p=\nroduct. But with the slowing economy, mild weather and consumer response to=\n the higher prices, power demand for 2001 is flat or even down from one yea=\nr ago in many parts of the country.=20\n\nThe recent actions of Constellation, Allegheny and AES likely indicate a fu=\nndamental shift in the electric business. Their actions are, in some respec=\nts, a return to the past-companies striving for predictability and reliabil=\nity in their power supply costs, profits and operations. Perhaps most signi=\nficantly, companies are once again rethinking their strategy in regard to w=\nhether or not they will continue to be an integrated business. As Constella=\ntion concluded, one way to achieve and maintain a critical mass of business=\n is to remain an integrated company. We would not be surprised if others co=\nme to the same conclusion.=20\n\n\nAn archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at\nwww.scientech.com <http://secure.scientech.com/issuealert/>=20\n\n\nWe encourage our readers to contact us with their comments.
