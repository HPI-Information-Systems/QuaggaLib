FERC commissioners said the new test would impro=\nve a system that allowed a meltdown to take place in the California market =\nlast winter, when wholesale power prices soared to record highs amid tight =\nsupplies. FERC commissioners agreed to produce a new market power test base=\nd on supply margin assessments, which examines a company's importance in se=\nrving peak electricity loads. \"If you're big enough to control the market a=\nt the time we look at it, you'll have mitigation put on you,\" said FERC Cha=\nirman Pat Wood.=20\n\nAnalysis: Many participants in the wholesale sector of the energy industry =\nare still reeling from FERC's new ruling, which may have slipped past some =\nradar screens considering that it was issued right before the long holiday =\nweekend. This is a mammoth ruling on FERC's part, however, and it holds tre=\nmendous impact for those companies that increasingly find the lion's share =\nof their profits coming from wholesale transactions. In addition, state reg=\nulators have also started gauging the impact of the ruling on retail rates,=\n which some utilities may seek to increase as a way to compensate for shrin=\nking profits in their wholesale operations. While FERC has presented this r=\nuling as an attempt to circumvent on the national level problems experience=\nd in the California market, the new limits on wholesale transactions can al=\nso be seen as another example of the \"big stick\" that the commission is usi=\nng to force utilities into participating in regional transmission organizat=\nions (RTO). Further, the ruling is another striking indication that Chairma=\nn Wood is following through with his promise to monitor rampant wholesale m=\narkets while still attempting to support competition. The objective represe=\nnts a tall order, and the new ruling from the commission is certain to prom=\npt intense resistance among companies involved in wholesale trading.=20\n\nPut into a nutshell, FERC has ruled that some companies can no longer charg=\ne unregulated, market-based rates for spot market wholesale transactions. I=\nnstead, companies identified as having market power and that aren't part of=\n an approved RTO must charge cost-based prices for power that isn't committ=\ned in a long-term contract, and publicly disclose those cost-based prices. =\nColumbus, Ohio-based American Electric Power (NYSE: AEP), Atlanta-based Sou=\nthern Company (NYSE: SO) and New Orleans-based Entergy Corp. (NYSE: ETR) ha=\nve been singled out as case studies on which FERC will be immediately apply=\ning its new standards for wholesale transactions. Note that Mirant Corp., a=\n former subsidiary of Southern Company, has also been identified as having =\nto submit information to FERC in order to gauge its level of market power s=\neparate from its former parent. The commission has essentially determined t=\nhat these three utilities hold an unacceptable level of market power in the=\n areas in which they operate. Under FERC's new market power \"test,\" a gener=\nator or marketer is viewed as having too much market power if its electrici=\nty is \"pivotal\" during peak demand, which enables the company to demand a p=\nrice above competitive levels. Regional transmission constraints will also =\nbe considered now as a measurement of a company's market power. This is a d=\nramatic departure from previous standards, by which (under one of FERC's ma=\nin criterions) a company that supplied less than 20 percent of the power ne=\neded in a particular region was freed from rate regulation on the federal l=\nevel.=20\n\nThere are some important exceptions to the ruling. First, FERC has not elim=\ninated the utilities' ability to charge market-based rates in areas where t=\nhe grid and markets are controlled by a FERC-approved RTO. This is signific=\nant, as I will expand upon subsequently, because it indicates that there ar=\ne secondary objectives in FERC's new ruling. In addition, the current rulin=\ng only impacts short-term sales transactions in which these three utilities=\n are involved. In other words, long-term contracts that the three companies=\n may have previously established or will establish in the future are not im=\npacted by the ruling. However, the three companies named in the ruling will=\n have to post pricing information related to long-term contracts, and FERC =\nhas retained the possibility that further price mitigation for long-term co=\nntracts may be necessary. Also note that the Western market, which already =\nis under a price mitigation policy that FERC imposed in June, was not inclu=\nded in the new ruling.=20\n\nThe three utilities named in the ruling now have 15 days to submit proposal=\ns to FERC outlining a transition to charging cost-based wholesale rates for=\n all power not currently committed to a buyer. Specifically, the utilities =\nwill have to post on their open-access same-time information systems (OASIS=\n) the incremental cost of producing the uncommitted power during each hour =\nin a 24-hour period. Moving forward, the price that the utilities can charg=\ne for non-committed power on the spot market will be the difference between=\n their cost of production and the bid of more expensive power in the region=\n that their power displaces. The new cost-based rates must be administered =\nby an independent third party.=20\n\nThe new pricing standards revert back to an older, cost-based technique kno=\nwn as \"split the savings.\" The methodology for this standard can get rather=\n complicated, but essentially under FERC's new ruling the three companies i=\ndentified will have to post their cost-based, incremental costs for spot po=\nwer into the OASIS system for viewing by potential purchases. Purchasers wh=\no want to make a bid will post their decremental energy bid for not produci=\nng or buying the power on their own. The final price for the transactions w=\nill be the split between the seller's incremental cost and the buyer's decr=\nemental bid. For instance, if Southern Company bids its incremental cost at=\n $20/MWh and a purchaser bids its decremental cost at $30/MWh, the transact=\nion price would be $25/MWh. Assuming a midnight-to-midnight trading day, se=\nllers would have to submit their incremental bid by noon on the previous da=\ny and buyers would submit their decremental bids by 6 p.m. What this potent=\nially creates is an \"information advantage\" for buyers who have six hours t=\no evaluate and respond to the incremental bids from some sellers. Some of t=\nhe drawbacks to this system are that it requires both parties to post price=\n information that may not be readily available and it potentially allows th=\ne purchaser to game the system by having access to the seller's original in=\ncremental bid and competing around the seller's price.=20\n\nNote also that in a separate development FERC simultaneously opened a broad=\n investigation under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act to apply the new =\nmarket-based-sales policy to all U.S. sellers nationwide. What this means i=\ns that, although only three utilities are mentioned in this initial order, =\nit is expected that FERC will continue to take steps to constrain what it b=\nelieves to be erratic wholesale markets. Reportedly, some 30 companies are =\nawaiting similar reviews by FERC to determine if the commission believes th=\ney exert market power. The 206 investigation reportedly also requires power=\n providers with market-based sales authority to amend their tariffs within =\n60 days to provide FERC with open-ended authority to order refunds if the c=\nommission determines that market manipulation has occurred.=20\n\nI made a previous reference to the \"big stick\" that FERC is carrying relate=\nd to participation in RTOs. Remember that a few months ago, Chairman Wood h=\nad threatened to deny utilities that refused to join an RTO the benefits of=\n charging market-based wholesale rates and swift approvals for merger appli=\ncations, advantages that the chairman equated with the \"new world\" of the d=\neregulated energy market. With this in mind, note that only Southern Compan=\ny, Entergy and AEP are included in the present ruling (although it may be s=\nubsequently expanded). Southern Company and Entergy in particular have exhi=\nbited some resistance in following FERC's consolidation mandate regarding n=\national RTOs, so it is probably not a mere coincidence that these three uti=\nlities have been singled out. This must be particularly painful for Souther=\nn Company, which gains a good part of its profits from wholesale trading an=\nd previously expressed plans to double the size of its generation assets ov=\ner the next five years.=20\n\nInterestingly, Commissioner Linda Key Breathitt represented the single diss=\nenting vote in the ruling. Breathitt's concern was that the ruling had been=\n pulled together too quickly and not enough time had been provided to evalu=\nate the impact on wholesale markets. This issue will undoubtedly be contest=\ned, and to a certain extent the utilities impacted by the ruling appear to =\nhave been caught off-guard. AEP, Entergy and Southern Company all issued st=\natements to the effect that they were uncertain about the extent to which t=\nhe ruling would impact them, and that they were reserving the right for pos=\nsible litigation.=20\n\nMoreover, to summarize the commission's rulemaking, I think there are a han=\ndful of important points that should be considered. First, the ruling illus=\ntrates the steps that FERC is taking to revoke market-price authority that =\nwas for the most part unrestricted prior to the time that Pat Wood assumed =\nhis post as chairman. Second, FERC is implementing cost-based prices on the=\n spot market only, and in only very defined circumstances. However, this co=\nuld be an indication that the commission may extend cost-based pricing to o=\nther wholesale transactions, including long-term contracts, at a later time=\n. Third, the \"split the savings\" cost-based formula could become fraught wi=\nth its own problems. Its requirements are rather complex and it offers the =\npotential to give power purchasers a market advantage on the spot market ov=\ner power sellers, which will now be required to post incremental costs in t=\nhe bidding process. Finally, one of the inherent drivers of FERC's new ruli=\nng is its desire to have large utilities join the RTOs that the commission =\nhas approved. It is very significant that the new ruling immediately impact=\ns AEP, Entergy and Southern Company, utilities that have not only been deem=\ned by the commission to have market power in their regions but which have a=\nlso not yet joined an approved RTO. However, even though only three compani=\nes are immediately impacted by this ruling, it should not be overlooked tha=\nt the ruling holds impact for the market as a whole as other sellers now wi=\nll gain important pricing information about the major suppliers in certain =\nareas. Thus, overall this is a very significant ruling and one that could s=\nubstantially change the manner in which transactions in the wholesale power=\n market are conducted.=20\n\n\nAn archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is available at\nwww.scientech.com <http://secure.scientech.com/issuealert/>=20\n\n\n  _____ =20\n\nWe encourage our readers to contact us with their comments.
