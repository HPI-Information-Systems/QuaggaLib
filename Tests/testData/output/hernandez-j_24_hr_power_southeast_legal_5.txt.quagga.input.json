Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =\nfelt was critical. =20\n\nThe first major topic was \"How many RTOs?  What is their scope?\"  All panel=\nists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=\ny FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=\nge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.\n\nThe next topic was, \"What will be standard market design?\"  Panelists varie=\nd on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=\nor one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=\nndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=\nfollowed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=\nnt situation.\n\nThe commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=\nt the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic=\n throughout their discussions, asking questions like, \"Do we need to issue =\na Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?\" and, \"How much detail do you=\n need us to provide?\"   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =\nwanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=\no say FERC should \"Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a=\n little further.\"  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=\nt in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=\nhe need for cautious investigation. =20\n\nOne item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=\nheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=\ne \"RTO Design and RTO Implementation\" section would address many of the que=\nstions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=\nos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =\na course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=\nction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =\nquestions:\n\n\n?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=\nr, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=\ns nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there=\n be others that must be accommodated?\n\n\n?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=\nedule (\"covered\" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=\ning from congestion charges (both \"covered\" and \"uncovered\" schedules are a=\nllowed)?=20\n\n\n?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =\nservices appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues=\n to be addressed?\n\n\n?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=\nior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=\nre those contracts?  Are there other solutions?\n\n\n?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?=\n Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=\n, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=\ndules), or will they be required at all?\n\n\n?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =\nin standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary=\n services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=\nncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?\n\n\n?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? =\n Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=\nss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=\nly unwieldy?\n\n\n?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=\nd into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =\nnon-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=\nreat each NJE as a separate entity?\n\n\nHopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=\nl questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =\nto move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=\n, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., \"do congestion management\") will t=\nake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., \"LMP with financi=\nal hedging instruments\") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =\nabout moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =\nto move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.\n\nNow for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=\nred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=\non of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out=\n said, \"My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't =\nbelieve that that statement is true.\"  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=\nhat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert=\nion by the Northwest interests was false.\n\n\nNERC and GISB\n\n\nA great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=\ntting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, \"Are we looking at a bea=\nuty contest between NERC and GISB?\"  Cook and Boswell then went into severa=\nl short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants cont=\ninually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interesting=\nly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI=\nSB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the \"new\" structure of NERC and=\n did not focus on its history.\n\nBrownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a=\nsking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were=\n they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily a=\nble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin=\ng of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin=\nt, Brownell.\n\nMennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m=\nan.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos=\ned \"successes,\" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will =\nlikely remember that these \"successes\" have not been so successful, resulti=\nng in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments=\n in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show=\n the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.\n\nThere was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues=\n, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some =\ntalk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.\n\nThe arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur=\nged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade=\nrship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC s=\nomewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would=\n say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.\n\n\nAndy Rodriquez\nRegulatory Affairs - Enron Corp.\nandy.rodriquez@enron.com\n713-345-3771=20\n\n", "clean_body": "RTO Week\n\n <?xml:namespace prefix =3D o ns =3D \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" />\n\nDay 4 - October 18, 2001\n\nAfternoon Session\n\n\n\nStandardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices\n\nPanelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy Group; William P.

The section to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following questions:\n\n\n?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occur, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there be others that must be accommodated?\n\n\n?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to schedule (\"covered\" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges (both \"covered\" and \"uncovered\" schedules are allowed)?\n\n\n?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues to be addressed?\n\n\n?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing prior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to retire those contracts?  Are there other solutions?\n\n\n?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function? Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules), be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced schedules), or will they be required at all?\n\n\n?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?\n\n\n?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses?  Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technically unwieldy?\n\n\n?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrated into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to treat each NJE as a separate entity?\n\n\nHopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., \"do congestion management\") will take a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., \"LMP with financial hedging instruments\") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.\n\nNow for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) referred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out said, \"My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't believe that that statement is true.\"  He then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the Northwest interests was false.\n\n\nNERC and GISB\n\n\nA great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-setting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, \"Are we looking at a beauty contest between NERC and GISB?\"  Cook and Boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants continually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interestingly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GISB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the \"new\" structure of NERC and did not focus on its history.\n\nBrownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly asking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily able to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancing of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Point, Brownell.\n\nMennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-man.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's supposed \"successes,\" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will likely remember that these \"successes\" have not been so successful, resulting in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.\n\nThere was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.\n\nThe arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly urged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.\n\n\nAndy Rodriquez\nRegulatory Affairs - Enron Corp.\nandy.rodriquez@enron.com\n713-345-3771\n\n", "path": "", "filename": "hernandez-j_24_hr_power_southeast_legal_5.txt", "mail": null}}
