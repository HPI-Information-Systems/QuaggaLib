Army had a chence to win with a 32-yard field goal on the final play\nof the game, but UH defensive back Emile White blocked it.\nHouston had lost its first two games, 30-27, to Rice in overtime, and 28-13\nto LSU.\nNew Cougar coach Dana Dimel has installed an all-out passing offense and hi=\ns\nQB, senior Jason McKinley, is fifth in the nation in total offense with 333=\n.3\nyards per game.\nThe Cougars are sixth in passing with 346.3 yards per game, and WR Brian\nRobinson is among the national leaders with 31 catches for 299 yards.\nThe Cougars gained 524 yards against Army and ran 92 plays.\nDefensively, Houston has struggled.\nIn losing to Stanford last week, the Longhorns lost all three of the \"keys =\nto\nvictory\" I cited in my scouting report. They lost the rushing battle, they\ndidn't put as much pressure on the Stanford QBs as the Cardinal defenders p=\nut\non the Texas signal callers, and they had two turnovers, while Stanford had\nnone.\nThe Cougars are far less formidable than Stanford, so Texas should win fair=\nly\neasily.\nHere are three keys to victory, in my opinion:\n1. Do a better job of running the football. That's not a huge order since t=\nhe\nHorns are averaging only 50 yards per game on the ground.\n2. Protect the Texas quarterbacks. Stanford got five sacks and had tremendo=\nus\npressure on the Texas QBs most of the game.\n3. Put a lot of pressure on McKinley. The Texas secondary gives up a lot of\nbig plays when opposing QBs have time to throw.\nLong-Range Outlook\nCoach Mack Brown likes to talk about four or five \"key games\" on the\nschedule. He doesn't mean the other games are against patsies, but let's ta=\nke\na look at the teams Texas plays this year.\nFirst, there are six games the Longhorns should win. The opening victory ov=\ner\nLouisiana-Lafayette was one of those. The others are Houston, Oklahoma Stat=\ne,\nMissouri, Baylor and Kansas.\nIf Texas takes care of business in those six games, the other five will be\nthe key to going 10-1 or 6-5 or somewhere in between this season.\nStanford, as Brown noted, was one of the key games, so Texas is 0-1 in the\nbig games. The others are Oklahoma, Colorado, Texas Tech and Texas A&M.\nTexas needs to win at least three of those to have a chance to finish 9-2 a=\nnd\nwin the Big 12's Southern Division title.\nBig 12 Roundup\nTexas lost at Stanford and Colorado fell to visiting Washington in the Big =\n12\nConference's top intersectional games Saturday, but Iowa State's Cyclones d=\nid\ngain a measure of respect by whipping state rival Iowa.\nThis week's schedule is the last week before Big 12 play kicks off on Sept.\n30.\nBIG 12 STANDINGS\nSOUTHERN DIVISION\nConference        Season\nW   L  PF    PA     Pct.

He has great power,\noutstanding moves and tremendous speed. In other words, he has all the\nattributes of an outstanding running back.\nHe also has confidence. The Longhorns already have a commitment from super\nMidland Lee RB Cedric Benson, but Johnson says that doesn't worry him.\n\"I want to play on a great college team,\" he said. You're going to have\ncompetition wherever you go if you want to play for a winning program.\"\nHis coach, Jerry Bennett, is the brother of Kansas State's defensive\ncoordinator, and Johnson said the Wildcats finished No. 2 on his list.\nThe Wildcats also were after McFarland, a hard-nosed tackle with good speed\nfor a linebacker. He won a \"fat-boy\" 100 event after his sophomore year wit=\nh\nan 11.3 clocking. Only players who weighed more than 200 pounds competed.\nThe two additions give the Longhorns 15 early commitments. It looks more an=\nd\nmore like the Texas coaches will award close to 25 scholarships  because th=\ney\nstill hope to add four of five defensive linemen, a quarterback, a tight en=\nd,\na wide receiver, a linebacker, a safety and at least one cornerback.\nSeven of the Longhorns' 15 commitments are offensive linemen. Texas has\nsigned only three offensive linemen in each of coach Mack Brown's three\nprevious recruiting classes and he said heading into this recruiting season\nthat the offensive line was the No. 1 priority.\nBut he also said the defensive line was a high priority, and that is where\nmost of the remaining scholarships probably will be awarded.\nHere's a list of the Horns' early commitments:\nOffensive Line (7)\nJonathan Scott, 6-7, 290, 4.9, Dallas Carter, a national top 25 player.\nAbe Robinson, 6-6, 270, 4.9, Jersey Village, a national top 100 player.\nAlfio Randall, 6-6, 300, 5.1, Blinn JC, was a national top 100 player two\nyears ago.\nMike Garcia, 6-5, 280, 5.2, Galena Park, was the Aggies' top early pledge\nbefore switching to UT.\nWill Allen, 6-5, 300, 5.2, Cypress Falls, is in his three year as a starter=\n.\nRoman Reeves, 6-6, 295, 5.2, another of the state's top eight offensive\nlinemen.\nTerrance Young, 6-6, 340, 5.5, Longview, is tremendously strong and had\noffers from several top schools before committing to Texas.\nRunning Back (2)\nCedric Benson, 5-11, 200, 4.5, Midland Lee, the greatest Class 5A rusher an=\nd\nscorer in state history and a national top 25 player.\nAnthony Johnson, 5-11, 195, 4.4, Jefferson, No. 19 on my top 25 list.\nLinebacker (2)\nYamil LeBron, 6-2, 240, 4.7, Killeen Ellison, was the middle backer the\nLonghorns targeted early.\nLance McFarland, 6-1, 225, 4.6, Jefferson, No. 23 on my top 25 list.\nDefensive Back (4)\nCedric Griffin, 6-1, 180, 4.42, San Antonio Holmes, one of the state's top\ntwo cornerbacks.\nKendal Briles, 5-10, 175, 4.5, Wolfforth Frenship, a great option QB who wi=\nll\nplay safety at Texas.\nBraden Johnson, 6-2, 200, 4.5, Euless Trinity, a fine athlete who is playin=\ng\nQB this season.\nBrian Carter, 5-11, 180, 4.5, The Woodlands, a two-way star at WR and CB.\nRECRUITING NOTES: Super FB James Buchanon of Sarasota, Fla., plans to take\nhis official visit to Texas this weekend. . . DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia H=\nS\nin Placentia, Cal., says he will visit this weekend or the following weeken=\nd.\nJakes is playing nose guard this year and said he had two sacks and several\nother tackles for losses in Valencia's opening 24-0 victory over Palmdale\nHighland. He said Highland is supposed to have a playoff-caliber team \"and =\nwe\nreally shut them down.\" Jakes lived in Plano when he was in junior high and\nhe said he is strongly considering coming to UT. \"I really like the way\nfootball is king in Texas,\" he said. . . Super DT Tommie Harris of Killeen\nEllison and outstanding OL William Winston of Houston Madison both say they\nplan to come to the Houston game this weekend on unofficial visits. Harris =\nis\nthe nation's top DT prospect, and Winston is a dominating OL.  . . UT pledg=\ne\nBraden Johnson of Euless Trinity rallied his team from a 14-3 third-quarter\ndeficit to a 17-14 victory over Arlington Martin by running 58 and 1 yards\nfor TDs. . . DE Eric Hall of Clarksville, Tenn., took his official visit to\nTexas the Sept. 9 weekend and said he really enjoyed it. He said Texas is h=\nis\nfavorite right now, but said he wants to take some other visits before\ncommitting to anyone. Hall was born in Fort Hood and, like Jakes, says he h=\nas\nfond memories of Texas football.\n\nSatchell, Richardson Status\n\nTwo Longhorn freshmen football players, linebacker Aurmon Satchell and RB\nTyrone Richardson, have been lost to the team for at least this semester.\nSatchell and Richardson both said they have some academic issues that need =\nto\nbe resolved before they can return. Both said they hope to be back in Janua=\nry.\nSatchell is from Denver Jefferson and Richardson is from Clarksville.\n\nTrue Orange Observations\n\nCoach Mack Brown is in his third year of what should have been a major\nrebuilding job at Texas.\nThanks to the way he and his assistants took charge and changed one of the\nnation's worst defenses into one of its best, and thanks to the way they\nrecruit, the Longhorns are already back among the nation's elite.\nI know they lost at Stanford. I didn't like it. The coaches and players\ndidn't like it either. It bothers them even more than it bothers us.\nBut Texas hasn't finished among the nation's top 10 in football since 1983,\nso we probably all expected too much from this team. The Horns will finish =\nin\nthe top 10 again very soon and probably next year if not this one.\nWith three great recruiting classes already in school and a fourth in the\nmaking, there are going to be a lot more W's than L's in the weeks and year=\ns\nahead.\nLet's be grateful for what he and his assistants and players have\naccomplished and help them get back on the winning track.\n\nGustafson's Lawsuit Dismissed\n\nState District Judge J. Scott McCown ruled last week that former Longhorn\nbaseball coach Cliff Gustafson's lawsuit against UT athletic director DeLos=\ns\nDodds has no merit and he dismissed it.\nMcCown also said Dodds has official immunity from such a lawsuit.\nThe lawsuit alleged that Dodds falsified an outside income statement by\nGustafson and provided false information to then-UT president Robert Berdah=\nl\nthat Gustfson has violated university rules by maintaining a non-university\nbank account for a baseball camp. The suit alleged Dodds' actions forced hi=\nm\nto resign.\nThe judge ordered Gustafson to pay Dodds' court costs.\n\nBasketball Recruiting\n\nT. J. Ford, the outstanding point guard at Fort Bend Willowridge, says he h=\nad\na great visit to Texas the Sept. 9 weekend, but isn't ready to commit to\nanyone until he looks at some other schools.\nUCLA probably is the Horns' main competition for Ford, a super quick 5-11\nstar who is the state's No. prospect. He  led Willowridge to the state Clas=\ns\n5A title and a 36-1 record last season.\nCoach Rick Barnes only has one more scholarship to award, so UT's recruitin=\ng\nwill be over for this year if Ford commits to the Longhorns.\nThe Longhorn women are going to get a visit late this month from Kala Bower=\ns,\na 6-2 forward from Woodward, Okla.\nShe is a national top 25 star who plays on a team that has lost only two\ngames in the last two years.\nCoach Jody Conradt already has a pledge from the state's top prospect, 6-2\nforward Heather Schreiber of Windthorst.\n\nKelly to Miss Fall Semester\n\nSenior guard Darren Kelly  will miss the fall semester, Longhorn basketball\ncoach Rick Barnes announced last week. Kelly hopes to return to game action\nfor the Longhorns following the fall semester.\n\"It is going to be difficult not being able to play this fall, but I have\nsome academic issues that I need to take care of to return to the team,\"\nKelly said. \"I am going to attempt to take care of that this fall and hope =\nto\nrejoin the team in December.\"\nKelly was slated to return for his second season as the team's starting\nshooting guard. He earned Big 12 Conference All-Newcomer and All-Bench team\nrecognition as a junior, averaging 10 points and 3.1 rebounds per game.\nHe was third on the squad in scoring and second in assists (81) last season=\n.\nHe also was the top three-point shooter on the team and second-best in the\nBig 12 (.452), including a .500 mark in league play (25-of-50).\n\"I'm sad for Darren because he had made such great strides in his game duri=\nng\nthe latter part of last year and over the summer, and he had really taken a\nstrong leadership role on this team,\" Barnes said.\n\"With the addition of so many new guys this year, there's no question that\nhis loss in the fall will hurt us. Hopefully he'll be able to return to the\nteam and give us a big lift heading into Big 12 Conference play.\"\n\nA True Orange Subscription Is\nThe Gift You Can Get Every\nYear for Your Longhorn Friends\nA subscription to True Orange is the perfect gift for any occasion for a Lo=\nngh\norn who has everything else.

You're going to have\ncompetition wherever you go if you want to play for a winning program.\"\nHis coach, Jerry Bennett, is the brother of Kansas State's defensive\ncoordinator, and Johnson said the Wildcats finished No. 2 on his list.\nThe Wildcats also were after McFarland, a hard-nosed tackle with good speed\nfor a linebacker. He won a \"fat-boy\" 100 event after his sophomore year with\nan 11.3 clocking. Only players who weighed more than 200 pounds competed.\nThe two additions give the Longhorns 15 early commitments. It looks more and\nmore like the Texas coaches will award close to 25 scholarships  because they\nstill hope to add four of five defensive linemen, a quarterback, a tight end,\na wide receiver, a linebacker, a safety and at least one cornerback.\nSeven of the Longhorns' 15 commitments are offensive linemen. Texas has\nsigned only three offensive linemen in each of coach Mack Brown's three\nprevious recruiting classes and he said heading into this recruiting season\nthat the offensive line was the No. 1 priority.\nBut he also said the defensive line was a high priority, and that is where\nmost of the remaining scholarships probably will be awarded.\nHere's a list of the Horns' early commitments:\nOffensive Line (7)\nJonathan Scott, 6-7, 290, 4.9, Dallas Carter, a national top 25 player.\nAbe Robinson, 6-6, 270, 4.9, Jersey Village, a national top 100 player.\nAlfio Randall, 6-6, 300, 5.1, Blinn JC, was a national top 100 player two\nyears ago.\nMike Garcia, 6-5, 280, 5.2, Galena Park, was the Aggies' top early pledge\nbefore switching to UT.\nWill Allen, 6-5, 300, 5.2, Cypress Falls, is in his three year as a starter.\nRoman Reeves, 6-6, 295, 5.2, another of the state's top eight offensive\nlinemen.\nTerrance Young, 6-6, 340, 5.5, Longview, is tremendously strong and had\noffers from several top schools before committing to Texas.\nRunning Back (2)\nCedric Benson, 5-11, 200, 4.5, Midland Lee, the greatest Class 5A rusher and\nscorer in state history and a national top 25 player.\nAnthony Johnson, 5-11, 195, 4.4, Jefferson, No. 19 on my top 25 list.\nLinebacker (2)\nYamil LeBron, 6-2, 240, 4.7, Killeen Ellison, was the middle backer the\nLonghorns targeted early.\nLance McFarland, 6-1, 225, 4.6, Jefferson, No. 23 on my top 25 list.\nDefensive Back (4)\nCedric Griffin, 6-1, 180, 4.42, San Antonio Holmes, one of the state's top\ntwo cornerbacks.\nKendal Briles, 5-10, 175, 4.5, Wolfforth Frenship, a great option QB who will\nplay safety at Texas.\nBraden Johnson, 6-2, 200, 4.5, Euless Trinity, a fine athlete who is playing\nQB this season.\nBrian Carter, 5-11, 180, 4.5, The Woodlands, a two-way star at WR and CB.\nRECRUITING NOTES: Super FB James Buchanon of Sarasota, Fla., plans to take\nhis official visit to Texas this weekend. . . DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia HS\nin Placentia, Cal., says he will visit this weekend or the following weekend.\nJakes is playing nose guard this year and said he had two sacks and several\nother tackles for losses in Valencia's opening 24-0 victory over Palmdale\nHighland. He said Highland is supposed to have a playoff-caliber team \"and we\nreally shut them down.\" Jakes lived in Plano when he was in junior high and\nhe said he is strongly considering coming to UT. \"I really like the way\nfootball is king in Texas,\" he said. . . Super DT Tommie Harris of Killeen\nEllison and outstanding OL William Winston of Houston Madison both say they\nplan to come to the Houston game this weekend on unofficial visits. Harris is\nthe nation's top DT prospect, and Winston is a dominating OL.  . . UT pledge\nBraden Johnson of Euless Trinity rallied his team from a 14-3 third-quarter\ndeficit to a 17-14 victory over Arlington Martin by running 58 and 1 yards\nfor TDs. . . DE Eric Hall of Clarksville, Tenn., took his official visit to\nTexas the Sept. 9 weekend and said he really enjoyed it. He said Texas is his\nfavorite right now, but said he wants to take some other visits before\ncommitting to anyone. Hall was born in Fort Hood and, like Jakes, says he has\nfond memories of Texas football.\n\nSatchell, Richardson Status\n\nTwo Longhorn freshmen football players, linebacker Aurmon Satchell and RB\nTyrone Richardson, have been lost to the team for at least this semester.\nSatchell and Richardson both said they have some academic issues that need to\nbe resolved before they can return. Both said they hope to be back in January.\nSatchell is from Denver Jefferson and Richardson is from Clarksville.\n\nTrue Orange Observations\n\nCoach Mack Brown is in his third year of what should have been a major\nrebuilding job at Texas.\nThanks to the way he and his assistants took charge and changed one of the\nnation's worst defenses into one of its best, and thanks to the way they\nrecruit, the Longhorns are already back among the nation's elite.\nI know they lost at Stanford. I didn't like it. The coaches and players\ndidn't like it either. It bothers them even more than it bothers us.\nBut Texas hasn't finished among the nation's top 10 in football since 1983,\nso we probably all expected too much from this team. The Horns will finish in\nthe top 10 again very soon and probably next year if not this one.\nWith three great recruiting classes already in school and a fourth in the\nmaking, there are going to be a lot more W's than L's in the weeks and years\nahead.\nLet's be grateful for what he and his assistants and players have\naccomplished and help them get back on the winning track.\n\nGustafson's Lawsuit Dismissed\n\nState District Judge J. Scott McCown ruled last week that former Longhorn\nbaseball coach Cliff Gustafson's lawsuit against UT athletic director DeLoss\nDodds has no merit and he dismissed it.\nMcCown also said Dodds has official immunity from such a lawsuit.\nThe lawsuit alleged that Dodds falsified an outside income statement by\nGustafson and provided false information to then-UT president Robert Berdahl\nthat Gustfson has violated university rules by maintaining a non-university\nbank account for a baseball camp. The suit alleged Dodds' actions forced him\nto resign.\nThe judge ordered Gustafson to pay Dodds' court costs.\n\nBasketball Recruiting\n\nT. J. Ford, the outstanding point guard at Fort Bend Willowridge, says he had\na great visit to Texas the Sept. 9 weekend, but isn't ready to commit to\nanyone until he looks at some other schools.\nUCLA probably is the Horns' main competition for Ford, a super quick 5-11\nstar who is the state's No. prospect. He  led Willowridge to the state Class\n5A title and a 36-1 record last season.\nCoach Rick Barnes only has one more scholarship to award, so UT's recruiting\nwill be over for this year if Ford commits to the Longhorns.\nThe Longhorn women are going to get a visit late this month from Kala Bowers,\na 6-2 forward from Woodward, Okla.\nShe is a national top 25 star who plays on a team that has lost only two\ngames in the last two years.\nCoach Jody Conradt already has a pledge from the state's top prospect, 6-2\nforward Heather Schreiber of Windthorst.\n\nKelly to Miss Fall Semester\n\nSenior guard Darren Kelly  will miss the fall semester, Longhorn basketball\ncoach Rick Barnes announced last week. Kelly hopes to return to game action\nfor the Longhorns following the fall semester.\n\"It is going to be difficult not being able to play this fall, but I have\nsome academic issues that I need to take care of to return to the team,\"\nKelly said. \"I am going to attempt to take care of that this fall and hope to\nrejoin the team in December.\"\nKelly was slated to return for his second season as the team's starting\nshooting guard. He earned Big 12 Conference All-Newcomer and All-Bench team\nrecognition as a junior, averaging 10 points and 3.1 rebounds per game.\nHe was third on the squad in scoring and second in assists (81) last season.\nHe also was the top three-point shooter on the team and second-best in the\nBig 12 (.452), including a .500 mark in league play (25-of-50).\n\"I'm sad for Darren because he had made such great strides in his game during\nthe latter part of last year and over the summer, and he had really taken a\nstrong leadership role on this team,\" Barnes said.\n\"With the addition of so many new guys this year, there's no question that\nhis loss in the fall will hurt us. Hopefully he'll be able to return to the\nteam and give us a big lift heading into Big 12 Conference play.\"\n\nA True Orange Subscription Is\nThe Gift You Can Get Every\nYear for Your Longhorn Friends\nA subscription to True Orange is the perfect gift for any occasion for a Longh\norn who has everything else.
