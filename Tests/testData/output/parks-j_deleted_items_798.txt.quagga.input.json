Just as we first talked about with Bridgeline, they want to hold back an amount of inventory sufficient to cover the pre and post-petition demand charges.  My reaction is to sell the gas ASAP and worry about the remaining inventory later.  Please advise if this is a problem.  From my prior discussions with you, my understanding is that sales of gas by ENA are permitted without prior approval.
