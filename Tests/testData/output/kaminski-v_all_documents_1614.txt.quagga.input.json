If successful, analysts \nsaid, Enron's business proposition could go far toward generating a set of \noperating standards for the emerging SSP business. \n\"It's a market with mix of small and large players and companies that define \ntheir roles differently,\" said Ken Weilerstein, an analyst at Gartner Group \nInc. in Stamford, Conn. Enron's plan also could help enterprise-level users \nget additional benefits along with the storage capacity they're renting, such \nas security and disaster recovery support, he added. \nRavi Thuraisingham, director of global bandwidth risk management at Enron \nBroadband Services, said the new offering won't include additional security \nfeatures. But Enron does plan to standardize on a set of SSP services and \nbundle them with disaster recovery and communications bandwidth capabilities, \nhe said. \nInitially, Enron -- which had total revenue of $101 billion last year -- \nexpects to charge users monthly fees of $25 to $55 per gigabyte of managed \nstorage, depending on market conditions and the length of time a company \nexpects to need the capacity. \"We're there to try to discover a market \nclearing price,\" said Thuraisingham, adding that the service is tentatively \ndue to go online in the third quarter. \nEnron said it has already signed Best Buy Co., one of the leading retailers \nof consumer electronics, computers and software in the U.S., to buy the \nstorage capacity it needs to support a customer relationship management \napplication through StorageNetworks. Connecting users such as Best Buy to \navailable storage could take anywhere from three days to three months, \naccording to Thuraisingham. \nUnder Enron's plan, storage capacity owned by participating SSPs will be \nconnected to an existing network of switching hubs through which the company \ncurrently trades telecommunications bandwidth. Enron said it has 18 switching \ncenters, or \"pooling points,\" in the U.S., and another seven overseas. \nAt first, the company plans to focus its attention on SSPs in Boston and \nother metropitan areas where the necessary networking plumbing can be easily \ninstalled.

Later that year, it also launched a Web site called \nEnronOnline that oversees the trading of natural gas, electricity and other \ncommodities.
