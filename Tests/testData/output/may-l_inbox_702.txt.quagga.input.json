I/T Networks team will be connecting the new building network infrastructure located in Enron Center South (ECS) to the existing Enron Center North (ECN) backbone network.  While this activity is not expected to produce a disruption to network services, this notice is designed to alert the organization to our activities.  No network hardware or systems are anticipated to be shutdown.  The actual physical interconnection of the networks will be performed in the EB 34th floor Data Center.\n\nInterconnection activities are scheduled to occur the evening of June 9th 2001 starting from 7:00 p.m.(CT) and completing around 11:00 p.m. (CT). Application testing activities will begin at 11:00 p.m. (CT) once all network testing has completed.\n\nIf you have any further questions, please contact Pete Castrejana at 713-410-0642 for more information.\n\t\t    \n\nSCHEDULED SYSTEM OUTAGES: \n\nARDMORE DATA CENTER - FACILITY OPERATIONS: No Scheduled Outages.\n\nAZURIX: No Scheduled Outages.\n\nEB34 DATA CENTER - FACILITY OPERATIONS: No Scheduled Outages.\n\nEDI SERVER: No Scheduled Outages.\n\nENRON CENTER SOUTH DATA CENTER - FACILITY OPERATIONS: No Scheduled Outages\n\nENRON NORTH AMERICAN LANS:  \nImpact:  ENS\nTime:  Fri 6/1/2001 at  11:00:00 PM CT thru Fri 6/1/2001 at  11:45:00 PM CT\n\tFri 6/1/2001 at    9:00:00 PM PT thru Fri 6/1/2001 at     9:45:00 PM PT\n\tSat 6/2/2001 at  5:00:00 AM London thru Sat 6/2/2001 at  5:45:00 AM London\nOutage:  Enable routing on new router ecn-34-cor-ccr1\nEnvironments Impacted:  ENS\nPurpose: This router will be used to connect to the new building\nBackout: remove routing on the router.\nContact(s): \tScott Shishido    713-853-9780\n\nImpact:  AEP\nTime:  Fri 6/1/2001 at  8:00:00 PM CT thru Fri 6/1/2001 at  8:30:00 PM CT\n\tFri 6/1/2001 at  6:00:00 PM PT thru Fri 6/1/2001 at  6:30:00 PM PT\n\tSat 6/2/2001 at  2:00:00 AM London thru Sat 6/2/2001 at  2:30:00 AM London\nOutage:  Shutting off the internal link to 1201 Louisiana\nEnvironments Impacted:  AEP\nPurpose: Company occupying that space has been sold.\nBackout: None\nContact(s): \tGarhett Clark         713-345-9953\n                        Robert Humlicek   713-853-6366   713-406-8293\n\t\t    \t\t    \t\t    \t\t\nImpact:  ENS/GCO\nTime:  Fri 6/1/2001    thru Wed 7/4/2001   \nOutage:  HPL migration to AEP\nEnvironments Impacted:  GCO\nPurpose: Sites sold\nBackout: None\nContact(s): \tGarhett Clark         713-345-9953\n\t\tRobert Humlicek   713-853-6366   713-406-8293\n\nFIELD SERVICES:  No Scheduled Outages.\n\nINTERNET: \nImpact:  Internet\nTime:  Fri 6/1/2001 at  10:30:00 PM CT thru Fri 6/1/2001 at  10:45:00 PM CT\n\tFri 6/1/2001 at    8:30:00 PM PT thru Fri 6/1/2001 at     8:45:00 PM PT\n\tSat 6/2/2001 at  4:30:00 AM London thru Sat 6/2/2001 at  4:45:00 AM London\nOutage:  Reboot Enron.com edge routers\nEnvironments Impacted:  Internet\nPurpose: Regular reboot to prevent such problems as memory corruption.
