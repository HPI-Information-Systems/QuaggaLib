The ARM coalition of energy service providers has been the \nfocal point of the ever-growing coalition that has developed (and continues \nto develop) around the Direct Access issue.\n\nIn order to succeed, it is critical to get as many members of the Silicon \nValley Manufactures' Group to join in the effort and participate actively, \nparticularly in the media effort.  \n\nMy colleague Sue Mara has been a key player in the ARM coalition and in the \ndevelopment of the medial effort.  She can provide you with any information \nand/or assistance that you need and can also get you in contact with Edelman, \nthe PR firm directing the media effort.  Sue's number is 415.782.7802.

We are drafting a \"pitch letter\" to send out by the end of this week\nvia blast e-mail and fax to the following media lists: 1)capitol press corps\nreporters; 2) mainstream media reporters working the energy crisis; and 3)\ntrade media.  We may also outreach to our editorial board list as well.  Our\npitch will be focused on what it will really mean for small business and C&I\ncustomers to lose the option of retail choice at a time when they are\nsuffering the financial hardships of skyrocketing energy bills. We will\naddress the effect on California's future business climate if direct access\nis not preserved through legislation that corrects the problems that AB1x\ncaused for retail choice.  And finally, we will address the point that no\nmatter what direction California ultimately takes, direct access must be a\npart of the solution.  Reporters have seen the recent polls which illustrate\nCalifornia businesses' concerns with the path the state is on so this is a\nprime opportunity to build on those recent media stories.\n\n2.    We recommend a conference call with AReM and the Direct Access\nCoalition on Friday to address the questions and suggestions on the press\nstrategy outlined here.\n\n3.     Determine which people in the Direct Access Coalition are willing to\ntake media calls on behalf of the coalition.\n\nNext Week\n\n1.   Follow up with key reporters who received the pitch letter.\n\n2.   Evaluate the language of SB 27x and determine whether there will be an\nopportunity to hold a news conference with Sen. Bowen in the near future.\nMonitor movement at the PUC and determine whether a press conference may be\neffective in this arena, or whether we may need to use the option of sending\na media alert before the March 7 hearing, followed by a news release after\nthe hearing.\n\n3.   Place op-eds (opinion pieces) with key newspapers.\n\n4.   Contact radio news shows and TV public affairs shows (i.e. California\nCapitol Week and the California Report) to secure\nmedia interviews.\n\n5.    Revise the SB 27x fact sheet (attached) to reflect the realities of\nthe amended language in SB 27x.\n\n What We Need From You\n\n1.  If you are willing to speak with the media, or you have\ncustomers/clients with a positive direct access story to tell, please\nrespond to this email as soon as you can with your name and contact\ninformation.\n\n2.  If you have draft op-eds written that need to be placed with newspapers\non behalf of your association and the broader coalition, we are willing to\ndo this for the you.\n\n3.
