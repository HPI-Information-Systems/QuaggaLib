He cited arbitrage between ", "the California Power Exchange (Cal PX) and Cal-ISO markets, a reliance on ", "real-time (rather than day-ahead) markets and a general shortage of power ", "supply in California as reasons why California's power grid was stretched to ", "its limits this summer. ", "According to figures presented by Alaywan, the instance of under-scheduling ", "was some 50% higher this summer than in the two previous summers. This ", "under-scheduling resulted in a total of 36 stage 1 and 2 emergencies between ", "June 1 and August 15 and dictated that the ISO curtail 13,450 MW on 12 ", "different occasions. In addition, the ISO spent $100,820,000 on out-of-market ", "electricity purchases during that period, up from $790,000 the previous year. ", "As a solution, Alaywan suggested increasing incentives to engage in forward ", "scheduling of power and that supply be increased. The Cal-ISO has made a ", "request for proposals for some 3000 MW for next summer to be used as a ", "peaking management tool, as well as allotting $800 million for transmission ", "upgrades over the next five years, Alaywan said.

To combat these shortcomings, Jeanne Sole, in ", "charge of long-term grid planning at the ISO, suggested that the ISO ", "encourage expansion of the gird and the competitive provision of electricity ", "for the California market. Changes must be made in the ISO and other entities ", "involved in power transmission and regulation over the next 18 months to ", "lessen the likelihood of such problems occurring in the future, the speakers ", "said.
