A  description of their account of the documents\nin Houston which appear to be called for by the AG's subpena to EES follows\nin the text of this e-mail:\n\n Discussion of Specific Document Requests\n\nNo 1.  All contracts for retail sale:  These are both in California and\nHouston.\nNos. 2 and 3:  All contracts under which EES has purchased electricity on\nthe western interconnection between 1998 and the end of 2003:  About five\npercent of these contracts are for green power made with various entities.\nThe vast majority, approximately 95%, are contracts with EPMI, which\npurchased all electricity load for EES.  There may be also a few contracts\nwith APX.  EES has paper fax copies of all these deals.  Their understanding\nis that EPMI charged EES exactly what the utilities would have paid on the\nCalifornia market.  While they do not know how EPMI actually provided for\nthe power, they believe EPMI probably did not buy most of it on the\nCalifornia market.  They believe all these contracts are voidable if they\nare revealed to any third party.  They characterize all this information as\nextremely sensitive.  They believe with this information, if given enough\ntime and a few other variables, parties could construct Enron's price\ncurves.\nNo. 4.  Documents which identify the purchases of EES for power in the day\nahead, hour ahead, or real time markets operated by the PX or Cal ISO:  They\nsay there are none.  EES was a scheduling coordinator, but never used the\nfunction.\nNo. 5.  Documents relating to portfolio of energy supply sources relied upon\nEES to meet contractual obligations to NU's customers in California:  There\nare no such documents.\nNo. 6.  Documents relating to the assessment of risks regarding:  the cost\nof purchasing electricity in California:  They do not believe there are such\ndocuments, but there may be presentations on this issue.\nNo. 7.  Documents relating to strategies or business plans designed to\nminimize risks with regard to the cost of purchasing electricity necessary\nto serve customers:  All EES officers and traders receive daily reports to\ncorporate goals for EES and show how EES was performing in conformity with\nthese goals.  They characterized these documents as extremely sensitive.\nThey use these on a daily basis.  Most of these goals are based upon the\nprice curves.  They also receive month end reports which show how each\ndivision is doing according to these corporate goals.  They believe that a\ncorporate function called Risk Control would have custody of these reports.\nVladimir Gorny (sp?) was said to be the person in charge of these.\nNo. 8.  Documents relating to decisions to return direct access customers to\ndefault utility distributors in California, including documents relating to\ncost savings:  They believe these documents exist in Houston.  They believe\nthere are spreadsheets which show the cost savings or revenue enhancements\nthat EES would have received as a result of returning customers to\nutilities.  They believe Don Black would have these.  They believe all these\ndocuments would reveal price curves.\nNo. 9.  Communications relating to the return of direct access customers in\nCalifornia:  There may be spreadsheets which exist on this subject:  They\nbelieve that Don Black would have them.\nNo. 10.  Documents sufficient to identify persons most knowledgeable about\ndecisions made to return direct access customers in California:  These would\nbe the same documents as No. 9.\nNo. 11.  Documents related to the assessment of the dramatic increases in\nelectricity in California:  They don't know if these documents exist or not.\nThere may be some presentations on the subject.\nNo. 12.  All documents relating to strategy and business plans designed to\nmaximize revenues from the sale of electricity in California:  They construe\nthis request to refer to origination documents.  These would be with the\nperson that was in charge of selling services in California during the\nperiod in question.  They believe Doug Condon (sp?) or Harold Buchanan would\nhave these documents.\nNo. 13.  Documents that show sales to California Department of Water\nResources:  They don't believe there are such documents.\nNos. 14, 15.  Contracts obligating them to either supply or purchase\nelectricity which they prematurely terminated:  They don't believe there are\nany contracts which they prematurely terminated.  Some contracts were\nterminated but by agreement.  The only possible exception may be the\nUniversity of California contract.\nNo. 16.  Organizational charts which show the persons with authority for\nrisk management.  They believe Dave Delaney or Marty Sunde, Vice Chairman of\nEES, might have such charts.\nNo. 17.  Documents relating to risk management of trading activities on\nCalifornia markets for electricity or natural gas and pipeline capacity:\nThese again may be guidelines which Delaney or Sunde might have.\nNo. 18.  Organizational charts regarding those who have responsibility for\napproving charters and objectives for making risk management decisions:\nThey believe Jess Hewitt's department might have these.  They believe these\nrefer to risk management procedures to prevent conflict of interest among\nEES traders.\nNo. 19.  Documents relating to development approval of charters and\nobjectives for making risk management decisions:  They believe there is a\nmaster agreement on this subject.  They believe Rick Byers (sp?) might have\nthis agreement.  They also believe this request refers to guidelines\nregarding conflict of interest for traders under their risk management\npolicies.\nNos. 20, 21.  Documents which identify financial and ownership positions of\nnatural gas or capacity to deliver and transport natural gas to California:\nGas contracts are handled by a different department at EES.  They believe\nthat some of these gas contracts were purchased by EPMI, but had no direct\nknowledge of them.  They believe EES may have purchased its own gas or\npipeline capacity because EES has the necessary credit to accomplish this.\nEES had its own power desk that scheduled gas.  However, they probably\npurchased most of it from Enron North America.\n\n <<ees houston meetings_.doc>>\n\n=======================================================\nThis email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.
