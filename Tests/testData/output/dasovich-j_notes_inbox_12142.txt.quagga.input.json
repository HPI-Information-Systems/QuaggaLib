Curtis Wagner, the chief judge at the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), also said a public hearing could \nbe quickly scheduled for Sunday or Monday if necessary to discuss his \nproposed settlement plan for California and other Western states. \nCalifornia has asked FERC to order refunds worth some $9 billion for alleged \novercharges for wholesale electricity during the past year.

Western states, plus independent generators, \nmajor utilities and other parties, are involved in the refund talks. \n*California Asks SEC to Review PG&E Utility Transfers \nSACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California's attorney general asked federal \nregulators Thursday to scrutinize PG&E Corp. for potential abuses in the \ntransfer of billions of dollars from its bankrupt utility Pacific Gas and \nElectric. Attorney General Bill Lockyer filed a petition in Washington D.C. \nurging the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to apply federal \nregulatory oversight to determine whether the transfers helped trigger the \nutility's decision to file for bankruptcy protection in April. \nThe SEC currently exempts San Francisco-based PG&E Corp. from almost all \nrequirements and review based on the holding company's position that it is an \ninterstate entity, Lockyer said. But the petition said because PG&E Corp. \ncontrols more than $13 billion in assets outside California and is pursuing \nbusiness activities in at least a dozen other states it is open to federal \nreview under the Public Utility Holding Company Act. \n*Bankrupt PG&E Seeks Approval to Pay Franchise Fees \nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Pacific Gas & Electric Co. on Thursday said it \nfiled a motion with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court here for authorization to \nassume more than $76 million in 510 franchise fee agreements with California \ncities and counties. The utility, a subsidiary of San Francisco-based PG&E \nCorp., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on April 6. The company \nneeds the bankruptcy court's approval to make the franchise fee payments to \nthe cities and counties, most of which will be due in the first quarter of \n2002, said Ron Low, a spokesman for the utility. A hearing on the motion is \nset for July 31, he said \n*EU Fears for Climate Deal After Australia Talks \nSYDNEY (Reuters) - The European Union raised concerns about global climate \ntalks in mid-July on Friday after failing to bridge a gap with Australia over \nhow to deal with Washington's rejection of the Kyoto global warming pact.

And as the coffee continues to \ntrickle onto the market the gradual erosion in prices is set to continue, \nwith $450 a metric ton a possible target. \nThe benchmark September robusta coffee contract on Liffe ended at $540/ton \nFriday, having set a new low of $532/ton. \n\"Technically the market is oversold but such considerations appear to have \nlittle impact in the face of overwhelming supply of robusta (coffee). For \nthis reason, the chances of a meaningful recovery are slight and the talk of \n$500/ton or $450/ton on (September) becomes even louder,\" one brokerage said \nin its daily report. \nApart from the fall in the level of the Brazilian real, Liffe coffee is under \npressure from constant origin selling - with India, Uganda, Vietnam and India \nall noted current sellers - and the lack of any frost in Brazilian coffee \ngrowing regions. \nAnd Brazil's coffee belt is seen safe from any crop damaging frost at least \nuntil July 20, according to Sao Paulo weather forecasters Somar Meteorologia. \nTemperatures may cool again from July 16, \"but we're not calling for any \nfrost risk yet,\" said one Somar meteorologist Friday. \nBrazil's frost season lasts into August, but as time ticks by, the risk of \ncrop damage recedes, traders said. \nThe Brazilian real's recent fall has been a major part of the recent falls on \nLiffe coffee, traders said, encouraging producers to sell onto \ndollar-denominated markets. Brazil is reported to have around 10 million-11 \nmillion bags of robusta coffee to sell, they said. \nAnd the outlook for robusta coffee prices is no better long term, traders and \nanalysts said. \nSome analysts had predicted that the low prices would cause producers to cut \nback or to move out of coffee production, but with the vast increase in \nVietnamese production in the past 10 years, little impact is expected if \nthere are any cut backs, said others. \nThere are plans to remove less productive trees in Vietnam, but this is \nlikely to be offset by younger trees in more productive areas reaching \nmaturity, said one analyst. \nIn the long term, participants believe the low prices will see producers \nbeing less able to add inputs, such as fertilizers and pesticides, which may \nhelp to stabilize production, but this is unlikely to cause the dramatic \nshift in supplies that is needed to lift world prices. \nLME Copper Hits Two-Year Low As Stocks Surge \nElsewhere, London Metal Exchange copper fell to a fresh two-year low Friday \nas early weakness was compounded by another steep invenventory hike before \nstrong trade buying and bargain hunting lifted prices for the close. \nSpeculator selling caused a sharp slump in the aluminum market overnight in \nAsia and leant pressure to the already nervous copper market, but it wasn't \nuntil the release of London Metal Exchange stock data that prices hit the \none-year low at $1,552/ton. \nCopper stocks rose a further 6,525 tons Friday, bringing total stocks to \n503,650 tons, a rise of 76,550 tons since June 22. \nAlthough the move has been widely predicted, such substantial stock builds \nwill still have a bearish effect on prices short term, an LME floor dealer \nsaid. \n\"You can't expect people to ignore stock jumps like this even if they have \nbeen expecting them for a while,\" he said. \nUnconfirmed talk is that major trade house Enron is behind much of the stock \nbuild, in an effort to reduce the market's nearby supply tightness and \nalleviate the large short positions they are thought to have built up on the \nJuly-for-a-week spread. \nWhen questioned, Enron declined to comment. \nHowever, the builds aren't thought to be over yet, said a London-based \nanalyst, predicting that another 30,000 to 40,000 tons of copper are set to \nenter warehouses over the next two weeks. \nLME three-month copper ended the late kerb $2.75/ton higher at $1,562.75/ton. \n-By Ian Stephenson and David Elliott, Dow Jones Newswires; 44-20-7842-9358; \nian.stephenson@dowjones.com -0- 06/07/01 17-00G\n\n\n\n\n\n", "clean_body": "INDIA: Indian states to issue bonds to pay utilities dues.\nReuters English News Service, 07/06/01\nFactiva Energy Digest - July 6, 2001.\nFactiva Energy Digest, 07/06/01\nCommodities Review:Coffee Hits Another Low,$450/Ton Eyed\nDow Jones Commodities Service, 07/06/01\n\nINDIA: Indian states to issue bonds to pay utilities dues.\n\n07/06/2001\nReuters English News Service \n(C) Reuters Limited 2001. \n\nNEW DELHI, July 6 (Reuters) - Indian states have agreed to issue bonds to \nhelp bankrupt electricity boards pay $8.8 billion owed to federal utilities \nbut they persuaded the government to cut part of the money due, Junior Power \nMinister Jayawanti Mehta said. \nThe move is seen as a vital step toward putting the ailing utilities back on \nthe road to financial health and reforming the power sector.\n\"There has been an agreement.

At \nthe end of the first quarter, it had about 631,000 customers, a company \nspokeswoman said. New Power said it signed an agreement to buy AES Direct's \ncustomer base and related assets, including natural gas inventory, supply and \ntransportation contracts as well as billing and customer service operations. \nIt also is buying Ohio-based customers from CoEnergy, gaining entry into \nservice areas of four additional utilities. \n************************************** \n\nREGULATORY & ENVIRONMENT \n*Germany Sets Up Power Grid Competition Watchdog \nBONN (Reuters) - Germany's federal cartel office is about to set up a \ndepartment to stamp out anti-competitive practices in power grid operations, \na spokesman said on Friday. \"The department will deal with barriers to free \naccess to the electricity grids,\" spokesman Stefan Siebert told Reuters. \"It \nwill take up its work this month and probably have four staff,\" he added. \nCartel office president Ulf Boege announced the installation of the \ndepartment in a speech issued along with the office's annual report on \nThursday. He said three years after market liberalization, established \nutilities were still blocking competition. \"These companies have developed a \nwhole array of measures to illegally prevent competition from taking place,\" \nhe said. \nThere have been numerous complaints about excessive grid access and switching \nfees along with other bureaucratic complications due to low voltage grid \nowners owning the \"last mile\" to the customers' site or home use to \ndiscourage alternative suppliers. \n*Belgium Government Holding Up Gas Market Opening \nAMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Belgium's move towards opening up its gas market to \ncompetition is being slowed because of government delays in implementing key \nlegislation, a senior official of the country's energy regulator said on \nFriday. \n\"Basically we are waiting for the decrees (from the government),\" Jean-Paul \nPinon, director of technical operations for gas at regulator CREG, told \nReuters on Friday at the sidelines of a conference. \"The Gas Act which is \nexpected to come in this summer gives an indication of how the market can be \norganized, but it gives no indication of when this will happen - the decrees \nwill do that.\" Pinon said the government was presented with proposals in \nOctober but had yet to give any indication of when it intends to publish the \ndecrees. \"I am amazed the first decree has not been published yet. The market \nis not liberalized because the decrees have not been enacted\", he said. \"The \nGas Act will give more freedom to liberalize through the decrees.\" \n*Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Pushes for California Refund Plan Friday \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Negotiations over refunds of billions of dollars for \nWestern electricity entered a critical stage Thursday, with the \nadministrative law judge overseeing the talks threatening to issue his own \nplan Friday unless progress was made. Curtis Wagner, the chief judge at the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), also said a public hearing could \nbe quickly scheduled for Sunday or Monday if necessary to discuss his \nproposed settlement plan for California and other Western states. \nCalifornia has asked FERC to order refunds worth some $9 billion for alleged \novercharges for wholesale electricity during the past year. In total, the tab \nfor the region's demands runs closer to $15 billion, counting the states of \nWashington, Oregon and others. Western states, plus independent generators, \nmajor utilities and other parties, are involved in the refund talks. \n*California Asks SEC to Review PG&E Utility Transfers \nSACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California's attorney general asked federal \nregulators Thursday to scrutinize PG&E Corp. for potential abuses in the \ntransfer of billions of dollars from its bankrupt utility Pacific Gas and \nElectric. Attorney General Bill Lockyer filed a petition in Washington D.C. \nurging the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to apply federal \nregulatory oversight to determine whether the transfers helped trigger the \nutility's decision to file for bankruptcy protection in April. \nThe SEC currently exempts San Francisco-based PG&E Corp. from almost all \nrequirements and review based on the holding company's position that it is an \ninterstate entity, Lockyer said. But the petition said because PG&E Corp. \ncontrols more than $13 billion in assets outside California and is pursuing \nbusiness activities in at least a dozen other states it is open to federal \nreview under the Public Utility Holding Company Act. \n*Bankrupt PG&E Seeks Approval to Pay Franchise Fees \nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Pacific Gas & Electric Co. on Thursday said it \nfiled a motion with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court here for authorization to \nassume more than $76 million in 510 franchise fee agreements with California \ncities and counties. The utility, a subsidiary of San Francisco-based PG&E \nCorp., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on April 6. The company \nneeds the bankruptcy court's approval to make the franchise fee payments to \nthe cities and counties, most of which will be due in the first quarter of \n2002, said Ron Low, a spokesman for the utility. A hearing on the motion is \nset for July 31, he said \n*EU Fears for Climate Deal After Australia Talks \nSYDNEY (Reuters) - The European Union raised concerns about global climate \ntalks in mid-July on Friday after failing to bridge a gap with Australia over \nhow to deal with Washington's rejection of the Kyoto global warming pact. In \ntalks with a visiting EU delegation, Canberra stuck by its view the agreement \nbetween industrialized countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions was dead \nwithout U.S. support, Environment Minister Robert Hill said. \nWith Japan also preferring to bring the world's top polluter back into the \nfold before pressing on with Kyoto, Belgian Energy Minister Olivier Deleuze \nacknowledged it would be tough to win a consensus at the next world climate \ntalks in Bonn on July 16. \"I think that in Bonn there should be negotiations \nwith success at the end with as many countries as possible and we don't have \nthis certainty today,\" Deleuze told reporters in Sydney. \n************************************** \n\nFull versions of these and other energy stories are available from Dow\nJones Interactive and Reuters Business Briefing \n\n************************************** \n\nFactiva Contact: Marc Donatiello, +1 609-627-2659, \nmarc.donatiello@factiva.com. \n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.). \nHomepage Address: http://www.factiva.com.\n\nCommodities Review:Coffee Hits Another Low,$450/Ton Eyed\nBy Ian Stephenson and David Elliott\nOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES\n\n07/06/2001\nDow Jones Commodities Service\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n\nLONDON -(Dow Jones)- Robusta coffee futures traded in London fell to another \nfresh 30-year low Friday as the glut of coffee on world markets continued to \nweigh on the market. \nAnd the market is set to continue even lower short term, barring a frost in \nBrazil, as further supplies come onto the market, traders and analysts said.\n\"The whole market is consumed with coffee, wherever you look it is there,\" a \nLiffe coffee broker said. \n\"We're in a downward spiral and there's nothing out there to stop us going \nlower still,\" said another broker. \nDespite hovering above record low prices for some time, producers aren't \nbeing deterred from producing or selling. And as the coffee continues to \ntrickle onto the market the gradual erosion in prices is set to continue, \nwith $450 a metric ton a possible target. \nThe benchmark September robusta coffee contract on Liffe ended at $540/ton \nFriday, having set a new low of $532/ton. \n\"Technically the market is oversold but such considerations appear to have \nlittle impact in the face of overwhelming supply of robusta (coffee). For \nthis reason, the chances of a meaningful recovery are slight and the talk of \n$500/ton or $450/ton on (September) becomes even louder,\" one brokerage said \nin its daily report. \nApart from the fall in the level of the Brazilian real, Liffe coffee is under \npressure from constant origin selling - with India, Uganda, Vietnam and India \nall noted current sellers - and the lack of any frost in Brazilian coffee \ngrowing regions. \nAnd Brazil's coffee belt is seen safe from any crop damaging frost at least \nuntil July 20, according to Sao Paulo weather forecasters Somar Meteorologia. \nTemperatures may cool again from July 16, \"but we're not calling for any \nfrost risk yet,\" said one Somar meteorologist Friday. \nBrazil's frost season lasts into August, but as time ticks by, the risk of \ncrop damage recedes, traders said. \nThe Brazilian real's recent fall has been a major part of the recent falls on \nLiffe coffee, traders said, encouraging producers to sell onto \ndollar-denominated markets. Brazil is reported to have around 10 million-11 \nmillion bags of robusta coffee to sell, they said. \nAnd the outlook for robusta coffee prices is no better long term, traders and \nanalysts said. \nSome analysts had predicted that the low prices would cause producers to cut \nback or to move out of coffee production, but with the vast increase in \nVietnamese production in the past 10 years, little impact is expected if \nthere are any cut backs, said others. \nThere are plans to remove less productive trees in Vietnam, but this is \nlikely to be offset by younger trees in more productive areas reaching \nmaturity, said one analyst. \nIn the long term, participants believe the low prices will see producers \nbeing less able to add inputs, such as fertilizers and pesticides, which may \nhelp to stabilize production, but this is unlikely to cause the dramatic \nshift in supplies that is needed to lift world prices. \nLME Copper Hits Two-Year Low As Stocks Surge \nElsewhere, London Metal Exchange copper fell to a fresh two-year low Friday \nas early weakness was compounded by another steep invenventory hike before \nstrong trade buying and bargain hunting lifted prices for the close. \nSpeculator selling caused a sharp slump in the aluminum market overnight in \nAsia and leant pressure to the already nervous copper market, but it wasn't \nuntil the release of London Metal Exchange stock data that prices hit the \none-year low at $1,552/ton. \nCopper stocks rose a further 6,525 tons Friday, bringing total stocks to \n503,650 tons, a rise of 76,550 tons since June 22. \nAlthough the move has been widely predicted, such substantial stock builds \nwill still have a bearish effect on prices short term, an LME floor dealer \nsaid. \n\"You can't expect people to ignore stock jumps like this even if they have \nbeen expecting them for a while,\" he said. \nUnconfirmed talk is that major trade house Enron is behind much of the stock \nbuild, in an effort to reduce the market's nearby supply tightness and \nalleviate the large short positions they are thought to have built up on the \nJuly-for-a-week spread. \nWhen questioned, Enron declined to comment. \nHowever, the builds aren't thought to be over yet, said a London-based \nanalyst, predicting that another 30,000 to 40,000 tons of copper are set to \nenter warehouses over the next two weeks. \nLME three-month copper ended the late kerb $2.75/ton higher at $1,562.75/ton. \n-By Ian Stephenson and David Elliott, Dow Jones Newswires; 44-20-7842-9358; \nian.stephenson@dowjones.com -0- 06/07/01 17-00G\n\n\n\n\n\n", "path": "", "filename": "dasovich-j_notes_inbox_12142.txt", "mail": null}}
