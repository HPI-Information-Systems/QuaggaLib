If \"W\" wins this election Megan and I are coming\nto DC to watch the Inaugeration and maybe go to a ball or two, so we should\ndiffinently get together.  I will work on that when the time comes.\nBesides, this election is absolutely crazy - Gore he working himself into\ncomplete retirement with all this contesting.  How is everything going?\nWhat are you guys doing for the holiday?  Megan and I are going out west to\ndo some skiing in Beaver Creek - I'm praying for powder.
