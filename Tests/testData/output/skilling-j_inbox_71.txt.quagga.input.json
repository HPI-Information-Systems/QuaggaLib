You see, last fall my daughter died of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), she was nine months old and if they find a cure for MS, the cure for SMA will not be far behind as they are similar diseases.\n\nSo I would like to pledge $500 towards the ride in honor of my daughter, Hayden.  All I ask is that when the ride gets really hard, to think of her & all the others like her that will benefit from this ride, then pedal a little harder.\n\nYou can send someone to pick up my check as I am located @ EB 3108F.\n\nSincerely,\nMichael L.
