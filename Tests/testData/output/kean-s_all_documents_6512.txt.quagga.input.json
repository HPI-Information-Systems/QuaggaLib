The complaints summarize\nthe issue as follows:\n\nThis action involves a massive conspiracy to eliminate competition in the\nnewly deregulated energy industry that has resulted in endangering\nCalifornia's electrical system and threatening California's economy.  It\nis perhaps the largest gouging of energy consumers in American history.\nSouthern California's current \"energy crisis\" is not simply the result of\never-increasing demand by a growing population for energy.  Rather, it is\nthe direct result of a conspiracy among the natural gas industry's most\npowerful Southern California players to preserve and maintain the market\ndominance that they enjoyed for many years as monopolies subject to\nregulation.  When the artificial monopoly created by regulation was\ndisassembled, those dominant companies took prompt and illegal action to\nensure that they would not lose the benefits of their market power.  Their\nunlawful collusion has contributed significantly to the recent\nastronomical increases in the price of natural gas and electricity.  As a\nresult, Southern California customers have had to pay billions of dollars\nextra for their natural gas and electric needs.  This lawsuit seeks to\nrecover those damages. (Para. 1 and 2 of complaint.)\n\n\n\"In September of 1996, top executives of Southern California Gas Company\n(\"SoCal Gas\"), San Diego Gas &amp; Electric (\"SDG&amp;E\") and El Paso Natural \nGas\nCorporation (\"EPNG\") met at the Embassy Suites Hotel, near Sky Harbor\nAirport in Phoenix, Arizona.  Fearing a new era of open competition and\nlower prices, these latter day captains of industry gathered secretly to\nhatch a conspiracy to dominate the unregulated aspects of the natural gas\nand electricity markets.  At the meeting, these three companies, who\ntogether dominate the Southern California natural gas market, illegally\nagreed not to compete against each other in the Southern California and\nBaja California natural gas delivery markets.  They also conspired to\nprevent other pipelines from being built that would have competed against\nthem and lowered natural gas prices in these markets.  The conspirators\nsought to eliminate competition, take advantage of electric deregulation,\ndrive up the price of natural gas, and profit from the increased prices.\"\n(Para 4 of complaint.)\n\n\nOne of the two lawsuits addresses the effects of the conspiracy on natural\ngas prices; the other deals with the effects on electricity prices.\n(The price of gas-fired generation establishes the price for most of the\nelectricity used in Southern California.)\n\nCopies of the two lawsuits filed this morning are available as Adobe\nAcrobat (PDF) files on the web site of the law firm of O'Donnell and Shaeffer\nat http://oslaw.com/osnews.\n\nAttorneys representing the plaintiffs are available for interviews, and\ncan also provide additional materials, including copies of the agenda prepared\nfor the secret meeting, as well as graphics illustrating the location of\nnatural gas pipelines that were planned, but then terminated by the defendants\nfollowing the secret meeting in Phoenix.\n\nFor more information contact:  Pierce O'Donnell or Carole E.

Many see constructing new\npower plants as the sole solution for bringing prices down.  However, E SOURCE\nresearch just out of the field indicates that convincing customers to reduce\ntheir electricity demand in exchange for cash could provide tremendous price\nrelief in open power markets.  \"Our study shows that commercial and industrial\ncustomers are very willing to reduce demand if the price is right, if\nmechanisms are in place for communicating those prices, and if they have a\nmeans of controlling their electric loads.  We found that larger customers\ncould offer almost 20 percent of their load as negawatts -- temporary\nreductions in electricity demand,\" says E SOURCE Vice President Bill LeBlanc.\n\nBecause most electricity use is considered essential and rising wholesale\nprices don't immediately affect end users, prices can go sky high when power\nsupplies get tight.  But if demand dropped in response to high prices, LeBlanc\ncontends that overall power costs would be much lower.  He explains, \"Although\nthere's a disconnect between price and demand in the marketplace today, we've\nuncovered a significant subset of customers who seem ready to participate in a\ndynamic pricing market.  Unfortunately, most of them don't yet have the\ncommunication and control tools that would make load management possible.\nThey also haven't been offered a pricing product they like.\"  The E SOURCE\nresearch study confirms that customers want flexibility in deciding whether to\nparticipate in load reductions on a daily or even hourly basis, as just one\nexample.\n\nSo how many negawatts are available?  According to the E SOURCE national\nmarket survey, medium-to-large commercial and industrial customers could\npotentially reduce their demand by 18 percent if offered a market price of $1\nper kWh (one of the tested price points) for reduced electricity usage.  At\nthis price -- which, incidentally, is what Edison International CEO and\nPresident John Bryson reported that his company paid for electricity on\nDecember 12 in wholesale power markets -- about 55,000 MW could be made\navailable across the U.S., and about 4,800 MW in California.  LeBlanc adds,\n\"We can't expect to capture all of this potential.  But with the right\nproduct, pricing scheme, and marketing, it would be possible to help relieve\nprice pressure on the whole system.\"  The E SOURCE study, \"Energy Pricing and\nLoad Management:  What Do End-Users Want?\" can help energy service providers\ndesign appropriate products and identify the customer groups most likely to\nparticipate in such programs.
