Thus it is vital that we analyze the California electricity shortage ", "and see if  we can develop a workable solution before we become bored and ", "change the  subject.

Nevertheless, ", "Franklin had proved an important scientific point, which is  that electricity ", "originates inside clouds. There it forms into lightning, which  is attracted ", "to the earth by golfers.  ", "", "After entering the ground, the electricity hardens into coal, which, when ", "dug  up by power companies and burned in big ovens called \"generators,\"  ", "turns back into electricity, which is sent in the form of \"volts\"  (also ", "known as \"watts,\" or \"rpm\" for short) through special  wires with birds ", "sitting on them to consumers' homes, where it is transformed by  TV sets into ", "commercials for beer, which passes through the consumers and back  into the ", "ground, thus completing what is known as a \"circuit.\"  ", "", "But enough technical talk.
